This central platform enables the Pristine Seas Science Team to maintain high standards of scientific rigor and transparency while facilitating efficient collaboration across our distributed team.\n\n### Core GitHub Benefits\n\n- **Version control**: Track changes over time with complete history\n- **Collaboration**: Multiple scientists can contribute to the same codebase\n- **Reproducibility**: Code tied to specific analyses or expeditions is preserved exactly as used\n- **Knowledge sharing**: Public repositories make methods transparent to the broader scientific community\n- **Quality control**: Pull request review system ensures code quality and consistency\n\n## Organization Structure\n\nThe Pristine Seas Science Team maintains a dedicated GitHub organization (`pristine-seas`) that houses all our code repositories, documentation, and analytical frameworks.\n\n### Repository Types\n\nOur repositories fall into three main categories, each with specific naming conventions and purposes:\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" icon=false}\n## Expedition Repositories\n\n**Naming convention**: `exp-[ISO3]-[YEAR]`\n\n**Purpose**: Code associated with an expedition, including data processing pipelines, analysis scripts, and report generation.\n\n**Examples**: \n\n- `exp-PNG-2024` (Papua New Guinea 2024)\n- `exp-COL-2022` (Colombia 2022)\n- `exp-GAB-2023` (Gabon 2023)\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" icon=false}\n## Project Repositories\n\n**Naming convention**: `prj-[Short-name]-[descriptor]`\n\n**Purpose**: Code for research projects, thematic analyses, scientific papers, and curiosities.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- `prj-Cyprus-trawling` (Trawling impact analysis)\n- `prj-scandola-algae` (Mediterranean algae study)\n- `prj-global-sharks` (Global shark abundance patterns)\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" icon=false}\n\n## Core Infrastructure Repositories\n\n**Naming convention**: Descriptive names\n\n**Purpose**: Central tools, packages, and resources.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- `science-sop` (This Standard Operating Procedures documentation)\n- `legacy-db` (Legacy database build)\n- `PristineSeasR` (Pristine Seas R package)\n- `pristine-seas.github.io` (Science Team website)\n:::\n\n## Repository Structure\n\nExpedition repositories follow a standardized structure to ensure consistency and ease of navigation. This structure helps new team members quickly understand our workflow and facilitates efficient collaboration.\n\n```\nexp-[ISO3]-[YEAR]/\n├── .github/              # GitHub specific files (actions, templates)\n├── R/                    # R functions and utility scripts\n├── pipeline/             # Data processing pipelines\n│   ├── pipe_benthic.qmd    # Benthic data processing\n│   ├── pipe_fish.qmd       # Fish data processing\n│   ├── pipe_pbruv.qmd      # BRUVS data processing\n├── eda/                  # Exploratory data analysis\n│   ├── eda_lpi.qmd       # Benthic data analysis\n│   ├── eda_fish.qmd      # Fish data analysis\n│   └── eda_pbruv.qmd     # Pelagic BRUVS data analysis\n├── docs/                 # qmds are rendered here\n├── .gitignore            # Files to exclude from version control\n├── README.md             # Repository overview and instructions\n└── exp-[ISO3]-[YEAR].Rproj  # RStudio project file\n```\n\nProject and infrastructure repositories have flexible structures based on their specific needs, but should still maintain clear organization and documentation.\n\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Data Storage Guidelines\n\n**We do not store data in GitHub repositories.** This is both a practical consideration (GitHub has file size limits) and a scientific best practice (data should be managed separately from code).\n\nInstead:\n\n- Raw data is stored in Google Drive (see [Google Drive](drive.qmd) documentation)\n- Processed data is stored in BigQuery (see [BigQuery](bigquery.qmd) documentation)\n:::\n\n\n## GitHub Workflow with R\n\nOur team primarily interacts with GitHub through RStudio, following the principles outlined in Jenny Bryan's \"Happy Git with R\" ([happygitwithr.com](https://happygitwithr.com/)). This approach simplifies version control while maintaining scientific rigor.\n\n### Basic Git Workflow in RStudio\n\n\n```{mermaid}\ngraph LR\n    A[Clone Repository] --> B[Make Changes]\n    B --> C[Stage Changes]\n    C --> D[Commit Changes]\n    D --> E[Pull]\n    E --> F[Push]\n    style F fill:#d8f3dc,stroke:#95d5b2\n```\n\n\nThe fundamental GitHub workflow for our team involves these key steps:\n\n1. **Clone**: Create a local copy of the repository\n   - In RStudio: File → New Project → Version Control → Git\n   - Enter repository URL: `https://github.com/pristine-seas/repository-name.git`\n\n2. **Make Changes**: Edit scripts, add analyses, or improve documentation\n\n3. **Stage**: Select which changes to include in your commit\n   - In RStudio: Use the Git pane to check boxes next to changed files\n\n4. **Commit**: Save your changes with a clear, descriptive message\n   - In RStudio: Click \"Commit\" in the Git pane\n   - Write a meaningful commit message that describes what you changed and why\n\n5. **Pull**: Incorporate any changes others have made\n   - In RStudio: Click \"Pull\" in the Git pane\n   - Address any conflicts if they arise\n\n6. **Push**: Share your changes with the team\n   - In RStudio: Click \"Push\" in the Git pane\n\n## Quarto Documents for Reproducible Research\n\nOur workflow heavily leverages Quarto documents (`.qmd` files) as the foundation for reproducible research. Quarto combines narrative text, code, and visualizations in a single document that serves as both lab notebook and reproducible pipeline.\n\n### Why We Use Quarto\n\nQuarto documents offer several advantages for scientific workflows:\n\n- **Code and narrative integration**: Seamlessly mix text with executable R code\n- **Reproducibility**: Anyone can re-run analyses and get identical results\n- **Self-documentation**: Methods are explicitly documented alongside the code\n- **Multiple output formats**: Generate HTML, PDF, Word, or presentations from the same source\n- **Version control friendly**: Text-based format works well with Git\n\n### Quarto in Our Repository Structure\n\nOur expedition repositories are organized around two main types of Quarto documents:\n\n1. **Pipeline documents** (`pipeline/` folder):\n   - Linear processing workflows from raw data to analysis-ready datasets\n   - Emphasize data cleaning, validation, and transformation\n   - Each document focuses on a specific data stream (benthic, fish, etc.)\n   - Final output is typically data tables ready for database ingestion\n\n2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) documents** (`eda/` folder):\n   - Scientific analysis of processed data\n   - Focus on visualization, statistical testing, and interpretation\n   - Often include publication-quality figures\n   - Can be method-specific or integrate across multiple methods\n\n## Embracing a Reproducibility Mindset\n\nReproducibility is fundamental to scientific integrity and is a core value of the Pristine Seas Science Team. Beyond just technical practices, it requires a specific mindset when approaching our work.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **Think of your future self**: Write code and documentation as if you'll need to understand it months from now with no memory of what you did\n   \n2. **Think of your teammates**: Assume someone else will need to use and understand your work without having you available to explain it\n\n3. **Documentation is not optional**: Clear documentation is as important as the code itself\n   - Document the \"why\" not just the \"how\"\n   - Explain analytical choices and their implications\n   - Note data quirks and handling decisions\n\n4. **No magic numbers**: Any constant or parameter should be explained and defined at the top of scripts\n\n5. **Embrace iteration**: Start with messy exploration, but refine toward reproducible pipelines\n   - Initial EDA can be exploratory\n   - Final analyses should be structured as reproducible workflows\n   - Improve code as clarity emerges\n\n### Practical Habits\n\n- **Start each analysis session by pulling** the latest code\n- **Commit frequently** with clear messages\n- **Review your own work** before considering it final\n- **Test with fresh environments** to ensure all dependencies are documented\n- **Keep raw data pristine** and document all transformations\n",
