The Pristine Seas invertebrate survey methodology provides standardized protocols for quantifying the abundance, diversity, and size distribution of conspicuous mobile invertebrates across different habitats and depths. These surveys complement our benthic composition data (LPI) by documenting the mobile fauna that drive essential reef processes and often serve as valuable fishery resources.\n\n## Method Overview\n\nThe invertebrate survey method employs a belt transect approach to systematically document conspicuous mobile invertebrates within a defined search area. This standardized approach enables quantitative comparison of invertebrate communities across sites, regions, and time periods.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Defined search area**: 50 m × 1 m belt transect (50 m²)\n- **Focus taxa**: Echinoderms, mollusks, crustaceans, and other conspicuous invertebrates\n- **Size measurements**: Targeted measurements of commercially important or ecologically significant species\n- **Standardized effort**: Consistent search time and methodology across all stations\n- **Integration**: Uses the same transect line deployed for LPI and coral recruit surveys\n\n## Field Implementation\n\n### Coordination with Other Methods\n\nThe invertebrate survey is conducted by the same diver who performs the coral recruit survey, as part of the three-person benthic survey team. This specialized diver completes both surveys during a single dive, performing the coral recruit survey first, followed by the invertebrate survey along the same transect line.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" title=\"**Invertebrate Survey Specifications**\"}\n- **Transect dimensions**: 50 m × 1 m (50 m²)\n- **Search width**: 1 m along one side of the transect line\n- **Direction**: From end (50 m) to start (0 m) of the transect\n- **Timing**: Conducted after completing coral recruit quadrats\n- **Duration**: 15-20 minutes per transect (standardized effort)\n:::\n\n### Data Collection Procedure\n\n1. **Survey execution**:\n   - After completing the coral recruit quadrats, return to the end of the transect\n   - Begin at the 50 m mark and work toward the 0 m mark\n   - Systematically search 1 m along one side of the transect line\n   - Maintain a consistent search speed to standardize effort\n\n3. **Data recording**:\n   - Identify all motile invertebrates to species level and count them\n   - For culturally and fishery important species, measure sizes in centimeters using slate\n   - Exclude species permanently attached to the seabed (except for scallops, pearl oysters, and giant clams)\n   - Note unusual behavior or interesting ecological interactions\n\n4. **Photo documentation**:\n   - Photograph all invertebrates not identified in-situ to species\n   - Capture additional images of unusual specimens or notable aggregations\n   - Document evidence of harvesting or ecological interactions\n\n5. **Quality control notes**:\n   - Note any deviations from standard protocol\n   - Document search time and any interruptions\n\n## Target Taxa\n\nThe invertebrate survey counts all motile invertebrates, with special attention to ecologically important and commercially valuable species. While we aim for complete enumeration, these key groups receive priority focus:\n\n### Major Taxonomic Groups\n\n:::: {.columns style=\"display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;\"}\n::: {.column width=\"33%\" style=\"padding: 0.5em;\"}\n<div style=\"background-color: #FFF3E0; color: black; padding: 0.7em; border-radius: 5px; border-left: 10px solid #FF9800;\">\n<strong>Echinoderms</strong>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0.2em 0 0 1em; padding: 0;\">\n<li>Sea stars (Acanthaster, Linckia)</li>\n<li>Sea urchins (Diadema, Tripneustes)</li>\n<li>Sea cucumbers (all commercial species)</li>\n<li>Feather stars (crinoids)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"33%\" style=\"padding: 0.5em;\"}\n<div style=\"background-color: #E0F7FA; color: black; padding: 0.7em; border-radius: 5px; border-left: 10px solid #00BCD4;\">\n<strong>Mollusks</strong>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0.2em 0 0 1em; padding: 0;\">\n<li>Giant clams (Tridacnidae)</li>\n<li>Pearl oysters (including Penguin's wing)</li>\n<li>Gastropods (Trochus, Triton, Conch)</li>\n<li>Nudibranchs & Cephalopods</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"33%\" style=\"padding: 0.5em;\"}\n<div style=\"background-color: #F3E5F5; color: black; padding: 0.7em; border-radius: 5px; border-left: 10px solid #9C27B0;\">\n<strong>Crustaceans</strong>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0.2em 0 0 1em; padding: 0;\">\n<li>Lobsters (Panulirus, Scyllarides)</li>\n<li>Large crabs (Carpilius, Etisus)</li>\n<li>Other large crustaceans</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n:::\n::::\n\n### Priority Species for Measurement\n\nUsing the centimeter-marked edge of the dive slate, measure sizes of these key species:\n\n| Taxonomic Group | Species to Measure | Measurement |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| **Giant clams** | All Tridacnidae | Maximum shell length |\n| **Pearl oysters** | Including Penguin's wing | Shell height |\n| **Gastropods** | Trochus, Triton, Conch, Turban, Green snails | Shell width/length per SPC guide |\n| **Sea cucumbers** | All commercial species | Body length when relaxed |\n| **Sea urchins** | Non-boring species (e.g., *Tripneustes*) | Test diameter without spines |\n| **Lobsters** | All species | Carapace length |\n\nRefer to the *SPC invertebrate measurement guide* for specific measurement techniques. Additional species may be included based on regional priorities.\n\n### Special Considerations for Key Species\n\n\n#### Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS)\nFor each *Acanthaster* individual, record:\n\n- Diameter (cm) from arm tip to opposite arm tip\n- Activity: (F) feeding, (M) moving, or (R) resting\n- Substrate and coral association\n- Aggregation density and condition\n\n#### Giant Clams\nFor all Tridacnidae, document:\n\n- Species-level identification\n- Maximum shell length\n- Position: (E) embedded, (L) loose, or (P) partially embedded\n- Bleaching status or damage\n\n#### Commercially Important Species\n\nFor locally harvested species, note:\n\n- Size measurements for population structure assessment\n- Habitat associations\n- Evidence of harvesting activity\n- Juvenile presence\n\n## Taxonomic Resolution\n\nAll motile invertebrates are identified to species level whenever possible. For specimens that cannot be immediately identified in the field, photographs are taken for later identification using available resources.\n\n### Identification Resources\n\nThe following resources are available to support species identification:\n\n- **On-ship reference books**: Expedition vessels are equipped with invertebrate field guides and taxonomic references\n- **Online resources**:\n  - InvertEBase\n  - Kwajalin Underwater\n  - Sea Slug Forum\n  - Sea Slugs of Hawaii\n  - Florent's Guide\n  - MyReefGuide\n  - MarineLifePhotography\n\nWhen species-level identification is not possible, the invertebrate survey follows the same taxonomic resolution approach used across all Pristine Seas benthic methods:\n\n1. **Field names**: Descriptive terms based on obvious morphological characteristics\n   - *Examples: \"black sea cucumber with red papillae,\" \"blue-spotted sea star\"*\n\n2. **Morphotaxa**: Consolidation of field names into taxonomic units with distinguishing features\n   - *Examples: \"Linckia sp. blue,\" \"Holothuria sp. black with red\"*\n\n3. **Lowest defensible taxonomic rank**: Formal taxonomic assignment based on available evidence\n   - *Examples: \"Linckia laevigata,\" \"Holothuria atra\"*\n\n4. **Functional group**: Classification into ecological functional roles\n   - *Examples: \"Grazing echinoid,\" \"Deposit-feeding holothuroid\"*\n\n## Data Processing\n\n### Data Entry and Management\n\nInvertenbrates data are recorded in standardized Excel fieldbooks on the same day of data collection, while information and memory are fresh. The `ISO3_YEAR_inverts_fieldbook.xlsx` is organized as follows:\n\n- `readme` sheet: Contains expedition info, data entry instructions, and guidelines\n- `stations` sheet: Records station information including sampling depths, habitat types, and protocol details\n- `observations` sheet: Primary data entry for all invertebrate observations, including counts and measurements\n\n### Processing Pipeline\n\nThe data processing workflow follows these key steps:\n\n#### 1. File Consolidation\n\n- Merge data across expedition legs and divers\n- Standardize taxonomic entries and size measurements\n- Integrate with site metadata from the UVS Sites Fieldbook\n- Verify data completeness across all stations\n\n#### 2. Data Validation and Quality Control\n\n- Flag missing data or outliers for review\n- Cross-check taxonomic entries\n- Verify transect lengths and search times\n\n#### 3. Standardization and Calculation\n\n- Calculate density metrics (individuals/m²) for each taxon\n- Compute biomass estimates for key species (where length-weight relationships exist)\n- Generate summary statistics by taxonomic group, site, and region\n\n#### 4. Database Integration\n\n- Format processed data for BigQuery ingestion\n- Ensure consistency with other UVS components\n\n### Core Output Files\n\nThe pipeline generates several essential files:\n\n- **inverts_observations.csv**: Cleaned observations with standardized taxonomy\n- **inverts_density_by_taxa.csv**: Density calculations by taxa and station\n- **inverts_stations.csv**: Aggregate metrics by station (richness, total density, key taxa densities)\n- **inverts_taxa_summary.csv**: Regional occurrence patterns and average densities by taxa\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nOur standard invertebrate data analysis includes several core components that are usually applied across expeditions:\n\n#### Community Composition\n\n  - Taxonomic richness and diversity indices\n  - Multivariate analyses (NMDS, cluster analysis)\n  - Functional group proportions\n  \n#### Statistical Analyses\n\n  - Tests for significant differences by region, habitat, and depth\n  - Analysis of key indicator species abundance patterns\n  - Correlation with benthic cover metrics from LPI\n  \n#### Spatial Visualization\n  \n  - Density maps for key taxa\n  - Geographic distribution patterns\n  \n#### Size Structure\n\n  - Size frequency distributions for key species\n  - Comparative size analysis across protection levels\n\n#### Integration with other methods\n\nThe invertebrate survey data can be analyzed alongside other Pristine Seas survey methods:\n\n- **With LPI data**: Examining relationships between benthic composition and invertebrate communities\n- **With fish data**: Investigating predator-prey relationships and trophic cascades\n- **With coral recruit data**: Assessing potential impacts of invertebrate grazers on coral recruitment\n- **With eDNA data**: Comparing visual detection with molecular detection of invertebrate diversity\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile the belt transect methodology is effective for surveying many mobile invertebrates, several limitations should be considered:\n\n- **Habitat complexity**: Detection probability varies with substrate complexity\n- **Cryptic behavior**: Many invertebrates are hidden within complex reef structures\n- **Nocturnal activity**: Daytime surveys miss species active primarily at night\n- **Diver avoidance**: Some mobile species actively avoid divers\n- **Spatial clumping**: Patchy distribution may result in high variance between transects\n\n## References\n",
