The Pristine Seas coral recruit survey methodology provides standardized protocols for quantifying juvenile coral abundance, taxonomic composition, and size distribution across different habitats and depths. These surveys complement our benthic composition data (LPI) by documenting the recruitment processes that determine future reef trajectories, especially in the context of increasing disturbance frequency.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe coral recruit survey method involves systematically examining fixed-area quadrats along a transect to identify and measure recently settled corals (recruits) and juvenile colonies. This approach provides quantitative data on recruitment intensity, taxonomic patterns, and early post-settlement survival, enabling assessments of reef recovery potential.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Standardized quadrats**: Fixed-area sampling units (25 × 25 cm)\n- **Systematic placement**: Regular intervals along the LPI transect\n- **Size-based approach**: Focus on colonies ≤5 cm maximum diameter\n- **Taxonomic resolution**: Identification to genus or species level when possible\n- **Integration**: Same transect line used for LPI and invertebrate surveys\n\n## Field Implementation\n\nThe recruit survey is typically conducted by the recruit/invert diver as part of the three-person benthic survey team. This specialized diver completes both the coral recruit and invertebrate surveys during a single dive, performing these tasks in sequence.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" title=\"**Coral Recruit Survey Specifications**\"}\n- **Quadrat dimensions**: 25 × 25 cm (0.0625 m²)\n- **Quadrat placement**: Every 5 m along the transect (10 quadrats total)\n- **Placement positions**: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 m marks\n- **Timing**: Conducted before invertebrate surveys\n- **Target size range**: Corals ≤5 cm maximum diameter\n:::\n\n### Data Collection Procedure\n\n1. **Deployment coordination**:\n   - The recruit survey utilizes the same 50 m transect line deployed for the LPI survey\n   - Begin at the 0 m mark and proceed along the transect\n\n2. **Quadrat placement**:\n   - Place the quadrat on the substrate at each 5 m interval along the transect\n   - Position the corner of the quadrat at the corresponding meter mark\n\n3. **Quadrat examination**:\n   - Systematically search the entire quadrat area\n   - Search for colonies ≤5 cm diameter (both established juveniles and recent recruits)\n\n4. **Data recording**:\n   - For each coral recruit/juvenile within the quadrat:\n     * Identify to lowest possible taxonomic level (genus or species)\n     * Measure maximum diameter (to nearest mm)\n     * Note attachment substrate type\n     * Document any partial mortality, bleaching, or disease\n   - Record quadrat-level information:\n     * Rugosity category (low, medium, high)\n     * Dominant substrate type\n     * Approximate sediment cover (%)\n\n5. **Photo documentation**:\n   - Photograph unidentified or unusual recruits\n   - Take reference images of representative recruits\n   - Capture full quadrat images\n\n6. **Completion and transition**:\n   - After examining all 10 quadrats, stow equipment securely\n   - Transition to invertebrate surveys (working back along the same transect)\n\n## Taxonomic Resolution\n\nCoral recruits and juveniles are often difficult to identify to species level due to their small size and undeveloped morphological features. The recruit survey employs a pragmatic approach to taxonomic resolution:\n\n1. **Genus-level identification** for most recruits\n2. **Species-level identification** when morphological features are sufficiently developed\n3. **Family-level grouping** for the smallest recruits (≤1 cm)\n4. **Photographic documentation** for verification and training purposes\n\n### Common Juvenile Coral Characteristics\n\nThe identification of coral juveniles requires specialized knowledge of early colony morphology. Common characteristics used for identification include:\n\n#### Acroporidae\n- **Acropora**: Early radial corallites, pale margins, initial branch formation\n- **Montipora**: Thin plating or encrusting growth, fine surface texture\n\n#### Pocilloporidae\n- **Pocillopora**: Verrucae (wart-like bumps) begin to form early\n- **Stylophora**: Initial branches are thick and blunt\n- **Seriatopora**: More delicate early polyp formations than other pocilloporids\n\n#### Poritidae\n- **Porites**: Characteristic porous surface, often mound-shaped\n- **Goniopora**: Extended polyps when active, visible 24 septal arrangement\n\n#### Agariciidae\n- **Pavona**: Early formation of distinct ridges and valleys\n- **Leptoseris**: Extremely thin, encrusting colonies with fine septocostae\n\n## Attachment Substrate\n\nThe substrate to which coral recruits are attached is recorded using these categories:\n\n:::: {.columns style=\"display: flex;

Characteristics used for adult coral identification may not be apparent in recruits, necessitating a focus on skeletal structures and early growth patterns.\n\n### Ecological Significance\n\nWhile coral recruitment is essential for reef recovery, it does not guarantee successful reef replenishment. The survival and growth of recruits into reproductively active adult colonies depend on multiple factors including:\n\n- Herbivore abundance (algal control)\n- Predation pressure\n- Environmental conditions\n- Frequency of disturbance events\n\nTherefore, recruitment data should be interpreted alongside other ecological indicators.\n\n## References\n\nArnold SN, Steneck RS, Mumby PJ.
