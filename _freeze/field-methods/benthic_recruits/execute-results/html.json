The Pristine Seas coral recruit survey methodology provides standardized protocols for quantifying juvenile coral abundance, taxonomic composition, and size distribution across different habitats and depths. \n\n## Overview\n\nThe coral recruit survey protocol involves systematically examining fixed-area quadrats along a transect to identify and measure juvenile coral colonies. This approach provides quantitative data on recruitment density, taxonomic patterns, and early post-settlement survival, enabling assessments of reef recovery potential.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Standardized quadrats**: Fixed-area sampling units (50 × 50 cm)\n- **Systematic placement**: Regular intervals along the LPI transect\n- **Size-based approach**: Focus on colonies ≤5 cm maximum diameter\n- **Taxonomic resolution**: Identification to genus or species level when possible\n- **Photographic documentation**: Each quadrat is photographed before examination\n- **Integration**: Same transect line used for LPI and invertebrate surveys\n\n## Field Implementation\n\nThe recruit survey is typically conducted by the recruit/invert diver as part of the three-person benthic survey team. This specialized diver completes both the coral recruit and invertebrate surveys during a single dive, performing these tasks in sequence.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" title=\"**Coral Recruit Survey Specifications**\"}\n- **Quadrat dimensions**: 50 × 50 cm (0.25 m²)\n- **Quadrat placement**: Every 5 m along the transect (10 quadrats total)\n- **Placement positions**: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 m marks\n- **Timing**: Conducted before invertebrate surveys\n- **Target size range**: Corals ≤5 cm maximum diameter\n:::\n\n### Data Collection Procedure\n\n1. **Deployment coordination**:\n   - The recruit survey utilizes the same 50 m transect line deployed for the LPI survey\n   - Begin at the 0 m mark and proceed along the transect\n\n2. **Quadrat placement**:\n   - Place the quadrat on the substrate at each 5 m interval along the transect (0, 5, 10, ..., 40, and 45 m marks)\n   - The combined survey area across all quadrats is 2.5 m² per transect\n\n3. **Quadrat documentation**:\n   - Before searching for juveniles, take a photograph looking down into each quadrat\n\n4. **Quadrat examination**:\n   - Systematically search the entire quadrat area\n   - Focus on colonies ≤5 cm maximum diameter that have a distinct tissue and skeletal boundary\n   - Exclude fragments or remnants of larger colonies\n\n4. **Data recording**:\n   - For each juvenile coral within the quadrat:\n     * Identify to lowest possible taxonomic level (genus or species)\n     * Measure maximum diameter to the nearest 0.5 mm (for colonies larger than 0.5 cm)\n     * Note the quadrat number to link records back to the quadrat image\n     * Document attachment substrate type\n     * Note any partial mortality, bleaching, or disease\n   - Record quadrat-level information:\n     * Dominant substrate type\n     * Approximate sediment cover (%)\n\n5. **Photo documentation**:\n   - Photograph unidentified or unusual recruits for later verification\n   - Take reference images of representative recruits\n   - Capture full quadrat images\n\n6. **Completion and transition**:\n   - After examining all 10 quadrats, stow equipment securely\n   - Transition to invertebrate surveys (working back along the same transect)\n\n## Taxonomic Resolution\n\nJuvenile corals are often difficult to identify to species level due to their small size and undeveloped morphological features. Given these constraints, our survey employs a pragmatic approach to taxonomic resolution.\n\n1. **Genus-level identification** for most recruits\n2. **Species-level identification** when morphological features are sufficiently developed\n3. **Family-level grouping** for the smallest recruits (≤1 cm)\n4. **Photographic documentation** for verification and training purposes\n\n## Data Processing\n\n### Data Entry\n\nCoral recruit data are recorded in standardized Excel fieldbooks on the same day of data collection, while information and memory are fresh. The `ISO3_YEAR_recruits_fieldbook.xlsx` is organized as follows:\n\n- `readme` sheet: Contains expedition info, data entry instructions, and guidelines\n- `stations` sheet: Records station information including sampling depths, habitat types, and any deviations from protocol\n- `recruits` sheet: Primary data entry for all coral recruits, including , size measurements and substrate type, and quadrat level info\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\" title=\"**Quadrat Image Organization**\"}\n\nThe systematic organization of quadrat images is essential for later reference and quality control\n\n  - All images should be named following the convention: [exp_id]_[site]_[depth]_[quadrat#].jpg\n  - Images should be stored in a folder structure mirroring the site>station hierarchy\n\n:::\n\n### Processing Pipeline\n\nThe data processing workflow follows these key steps:\n\n1. **File Consolidation**:\n   - Merge data across expedition legs and divers\n   - Standardize taxonomic names\n   - Integrate with site metadata from the UVS Sites Fieldbook\n\n2. **Data Validation**:\n   - Verify completeness of required fields\n   - Flag outliers for size measurements\n   - Cross-reference taxonomic entries against adult coral taxa observed in LPI\n   - Ensure consistent species identifications across observers\n\n3. **Density Calculation**:\n   - Calculate recruit density per unit area (recruits/m²)\n   - Generate summary statistics by taxa, size class, site, and region\n   - Create standardized density metrics for comparisons\n\n4. **Size Structure Analysis**:\n   - Group recruits into standardized size classes\n   - Analyze size frequency distributions by taxa and site\n   - Calculate size-based demographic metrics\n\n5. **Database Integration**:\n   - Format processed data for database ingestion\n   - Apply appropriate metadata tags and quality indicators\n   - Ensure consistency with other UVS components\n\n### Core Output Files\n\nThe pipeline generates several essential files:\n\n- **recruits_observations.csv**: Cleaned observations with standardized taxonomy\n- **recruits_density_by_taxa.csv**: Density calculations by taxa, size class, and station\n- **recruits_station_summary.csv**: Aggregate metrics by station\n- **recruits_taxa_summary.csv**: Occurrence and density by taxa across regions\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nStandard analyses conducted for coral recruit data include:\n\n- **Recruitment Patterns**:\n  - Taxonomic composition of recruits across sites\n  - Recruitment density comparisons by region, habitat, and depth\n  - Correlation with adult coral cover from LPI\n\n- **Size Structure**:\n  - Size frequency distributions by taxa\n  - Proportional representation across size classes\n\n- **Substrate Preferences**:\n  - Settlement substrate analysis by taxa\n  - Relationship between substrate availability and recruitment\n\n- **Spatial Visualization**:\n  - Geographic pattern analysis\n  - Integration with environmental variables\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe quadrat methodology for coral recruit surveys has several inherent limitations:\n\n- **Detection challenges**: The smallest recruits (<5 mm) are extremely difficult to detect in field conditions, potentially leading to underestimates of recent recruitment\n- **Taxonomic uncertainty**: Accurate species-level identification of recruits is challenging and often not possible for the smallest size classes\n- **Spatial heterogeneity**: Recruitment can be highly patchy, requiring sufficient sample sizes to characterize site-level patterns\n- **Temporal variability**: Recruitment is often episodic, with significant seasonal and annual variations that may not be captured in single surveys\n- **Post-settlement mortality**: High mortality rates in the first weeks after settlement mean that visible recruits represent only a small fraction of initial settlers\n\nThese limitations can be addressed through:\n\n- Comprehensive diver training in recruit detection and identification\n- Adequate sample sizes (minimum of 10 quadrats per depth)\n- Integration with longer-term monitoring where applicable\n- Size-based classification to distinguish cohorts\n\n## References\n\n",
