This versatile methodology samples fish communities from shallow mangrove channels to deep reef slopes, sandy plains to coral formations, and high-energy reef passes to sheltered lagoons—including habitats inaccessible to divers.\n\nAs a completely passive method, seabed BRUVS eliminate observer effects that influence fish behavior during diver-based surveys. Fish respond naturally to bait without human presence, providing unbiased observations particularly valuable for documenting sharks, rays, large groupers, and other predators that avoid divers. BRUVS are especially important for assessing shark populations, as shark relative abundance serves as one of the most reliable indicators of reef ecosystem health.\n\n![Seabed BRUVS deployment showing the stereo camera configuration and bait arm positioned on a coral reef slope](../assets/illustrations/seabed_bruvs.jpg){fig-alt=\"Seabed BRUVS on reef slope\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\nThe method provides standardized measurements of fish diversity, relative abundance (MaxN), and body size across depths and habitats not accessible through other survey techniques, making it essential for comprehensive ecosystem assessment.\n\n\n## Method Overview\n\nSeabed BRUVS employ stereo-camera systems with standardized bait to attract and record fish, operating as autonomous underwater observatories. This approach provides relative abundance estimates and precise length measurements for all observed taxa\n\n### Features\n\n- **Habitat versatility**: Effective from shallow mangroves to deep reefs (5-70+ m)\n- **Substrate adaptability**: Functions on sand, mud, rubble, coral, and rocky bottoms\n- **Current tolerance**: Operates in calm lagoons to high-flow reef passes\n- **Passive sampling**: Eliminates diver-induced behavioral bias\n- **Stereo cameras**: Precise length measurements via calibrated camera separation\n- **Standardized bait**: Consistent attraction stimulus across deployments\n- **Extended observation**: Captures species with different response times to bait attraction\n\n### Key metric\n\nThe fundamental measurement unit in BRUVS surveys is **MaxN** (Maximum Number): the highest count of individuals of a given species observed simultaneously in a single video frame during the entire deployment. MaxN provides a conservative, standardized abundance index that accounts for individual fish moving in and out of the camera's field of view.\n\n- Eliminates double-counting of the same individuals\n- Provides consistent abundance estimates across different deployment conditions\n- Enables robust comparisons between sites, regions, and time periods\n- Remains conservative when fish behavior varies\n\n\n\n## Field Implementation\n\n### Equipment \n\nThe system consists of a robust carbon fiber frame housing a stereo camera configuration with standardized bait attraction.\n\n#### Frame Structure\n\nThe BRUVS frame provides a stable foundation for varied conditions:\n\n- **Camera bar**: 80 cm carbon fiber bar housing stereo cameras at optimal separation\n- **Bait arm**: 1 m horizontal carbon fiber pole extending from camera bar to position attractant within camera view\n- **Stabilization**: Three carbon fiber weighted legs (2 kg per leg, 6 kg total) creating low center of gravity for secure positioning\n- **Surface connection**: Marker buoy connected via 30-100 m line with scope adjusted for deployment depth\n\n#### Camera System\n\nThe stereo camera configuration enables precise fish identification and measurement:\n\n- **Cameras**: Two GoPro Hero 9+ in waterproof housings\n- **Stereo separation**: 80 cm distance, 8° convergence angle toward bait\n- **Recording settings**: 1080p at 25-30 fps for optimal stereo analysis\n- **Duration**: Minimum 60 minutes continuous recording\n- **Synchronization**: Time-synchronized for stereo-photogrammetric measurements\n\n#### Bait Protocol\n\nStandardized bait ensures consistent fish attraction across deployments:\n\n- **Quantity**: 1 kg crushed oily fish per deployment\n- **Species**: Sardines, tuna, mackerel, or locally available oily fish\n- **Preparation**: Fresh bait crushed on deployment day for maximum scent dispersal\n- **Container**: Perforated PVC canister allowing scent release while containing bait\n- **Positioning**: Suspended 1 m horizontally from camera bar within optimal camera field of view\n\n#### Lighting System\n\nDepth-dependent lighting ensures adequate video quality for species identification:\n\n- **Shallow deployments (≤30 m)**: Natural light sufficient; no artificial lighting used\n- **Deep deployments (>30 m)**: Two 2600 lumen LED lights mounted on camera bar\n- **Light positioning**: Angled to illuminate bait area without creating backscatter\n- **Battery management**: Fresh batteries for each deployment cycle\n\n### Operations Schedule\n\nBRUVS deployments are conducted using small boats with autonomous operations independent of the main research vessel:\n\n**Daily Workflow:**\n\n- **Morning (7 AM -

Some species show strong positive attraction, others exhibit active avoidance, and territorial species may exclude other fish from the immediate area around the bait.\n\n**Size and Behavioral Bias:** Larger, more aggressive predators may dominate bait areas, potentially excluding smaller individuals or species. This can lead to underestimation of juvenile abundance and species that are less competitive around bait.\n\n**Temporal Coverage:** Standard 60-minute deployments provide only a brief snapshot of fish community activity. Species with different temporal activity patterns (dawn/dusk activity, tidal influences) may be missed or underrepresented.\n\n#### Technical Limitations\n\n**Environmental Dependency:** Successful deployments require suitable sea conditions and stable substrate. Steep slopes, strong currents, poor visibility, or equipment failure can result in partial or complete data loss.\n\n**Detection Limitations:** MaxN provides minimum abundance estimates as individuals moving in and out of the camera's field of view may not be detected simultaneously. Video quality affects species identification accuracy, particularly for smaller or more cryptic species.\n\n#### Methodological Considerations\n\n**Observer Effect Elimination vs. Limited Behavior:** While BRUVS eliminate diver effects, they may not capture natural feeding behaviors, territorial interactions, or species that don't respond to bait stimulus.\n\n**Community Representation:** BRUVS excel at documenting predatory fish but systematically underrepresent small-bodied species, herbivores, and planktivores compared to visual surveys.\n\n**Standardization Challenges:** Variations in bait type, quantity, freshness, and local availability may affect comparability between deployments and regions.\n\n#### Mitigation Strategies\n\n**Complementary Methods:** We integrate BRUVS with UVS, eDNA, and other techniques to provide comprehensive ecosystem assessment that accounts for each method's strengths and biases.\n\n**Standardized Protocols:** Protocols for equipment preparation, deployment procedures, and data analysis ensure valid comparisons across sites and time periods.\n\n**Quality Control:** Multiple deployment replication, video quality assessment, and expert taxonomic review address technical and analytical sources of error.\n\n**Appropriate Interpretation:** Results are interpreted within the context of method-specific limitations, focusing on questions that BRUVS are well-suited to address: predator abundance, community structure, and fishing impacts.\n\n## References\n\n- Cappo M, Harvey E, Malcolm H, Speare P (2003) Potential of video techniques to monitor diversity, abundance and size of fish in studies of Marine Protected Areas.
