## Overview

The Argo Network Attached Storage (NAS) serves as our primary data hub while at sea, providing high-capacity, RAID-configured local storage and file-sharing capabilities independent of internet connectivity. This system enables real-time collaboration, automated data backup, and efficient information exchange among all expedition members.

## System Architecture

The Argo NAS operates on a dedicated internal network accessible throughout the vessel, offering high-speed data transfer, automated synchronization, and robust storage redundancy. Each expedition member receives personalized access credentials with role-specific permission levels, ensuring appropriate access to data and collaboration spaces.

## Directory Structure

Folders on the NAS mirror the structure of the matching expedition folder in Google Drive, ensuring a seamless transition between at-sea operations and post-expedition data management.


## Daily Workflow

The NAS plays a central role in our daily expedition operations:

1. **Data entry**: Upload collected data and photos to the appropriate directories on the NAS (excluding remote camera footage)
2. **Daily backup**: Automatic daily backup of all new uploads to ensure redundancy and data integrity
3. **Early QAQC**: Preliminary quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) conducted by the data manager
4. **Species ID**: Collaborative species identification and validation based on shared images and video
5. **Planning**: Preparation for the following day's operations based on real-time sampling distribution updates
6. **Highlights**: Sharing of daily highlights, including images, video clips, and key findings.

## Best Practices

### File Management

- Follow standard naming conventions for all folder and files:
  - Example: `benthos/site-photos/PLW-2023-uvs-001/...`, `sbruv/PLW_2023_sbruv_fieldbook.xlsx`
- Save work to the NAS daily rather than keeping it on personal devices
- Organize raw photos by `station_id` or date upon upload

### Collaborative Etiquette

- Save Frequently
- Close files when not in use to prevent access conflicts.
- Share your photosâ€”contribute regularly to foster team collaboration

## Support

The expedition's data manager serves as the primary support contact for NAS-related issues, including troubleshooting, folder management, and QA/QC oversight.

## Post-Expedition Data Management

At the conclusion of each expedition:

1. All data undergoes final validation and organization
2. Complete dataset is backed up to portable drives
3. The full dataset (excluding raw footage) is synced to Google Drive.
4. Data is archived for future reference
