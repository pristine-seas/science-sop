## Overview

Google Drive serves as the primary collaborative hub for the Pristine Seas Science Team. As the foundation of our digital infrastructure, Drive provides centralized storage, enables collaboration, and ensures continuity of our scientific work.

- **Central Repository**: Primary and secondary data from field to analysis
- **Document Management**: Expedition plans, permits, reports, and manuscripts
- **Collaboration Platform**: Real-time collaborative editing and review
- **Asset Library**: Visual materials, presentations, and resources

## Core Structure

The Pristine Seas Science Team Drive is organized into the following main folders:

```text
SCIENCE/
├── expeditions/      # Primary repository for expedition data and documentation
├── projects/         # Research projects and papers in support of our mission
├── datasets/         # Useful and commoly used external datasets
├── resources/          # Shared materials and assets
│   ├── presentations/    # Slides for presentations, conferences, and meetings
│   ├── media/            # Photos, videos for communications
│   ├── illustrations/    # Scientific illustrations library
│   ├── methods/          # Field protocols and standards
│   ├── education/        # Training and outreach materials
└── operations/       # Administrative content

    │   ├── meetings/        # Meeting notes and schedules
    │   └── planning/        # Strategic documents
    ├── equipment/        # Inventory and maintenance
    ├── budgets/          # Financial planning
```

## Expeditions

The expeditions folder is the heart of our data organization system, containing all materials related to our field expeditions. Expeditions are given standardized ID (`exp_id`) that's composed of the **ISO alpha-3 country code** and the year of the expedition. In rare case when multiple expeditions occur in the same country within the same year, we add descriptive suffixes. 

::: {.callout-note title="**Expedition ID** (`exp_id`)" appearance="minimal"}


**Format**: [iso3]_[year]

**Examples:** `COL_2022`, `PLW_2023`, `ARG_2018_yaganes`, `ARG_2018_burwood`

:::

This naming system ensures expeditions are easily identifiable, correctly sorted by location and date, and consistently referenced across our platforms. 
```

└── iso3-year/
    ├── readme.md                # Expedition overview
    ├── data/                    # All expedition data
    │   ├── primary/             # Data collected by team

    ├── reports/                 # Expedition outputs
    └── references/              # Literature and resources
```

::: {.callout-important title="**Naming conventions**" appearance="minimal"}
All folder and file names should follow these conventions:

 - **Folders**: Use `kebab-case` (hyphens), capitalize only proper nouns
    - Examples: `esv-PLW-2024/`, `prj-cyprus-trawlers/`
 - **Files**: Use `snake_case` (underscores), capitalize only proper nouns
    - Examples: `FJI_2025_science_report.docx`, `YSI_manual.pdf`
 - Names should be **descriptive** and consistent
:::

#### `data/`

The data folder is organized by source and processing stage:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## primary/

Data collected by our team during the expedition:

- **raw/**: 
  - Original, unmodified fieldbooks
  - Site and species photos
  - Highlights from remote camera systems
- **processed/**: 
  - QA/QC procedures applied
  - Standardized formats
- **output/**: 
  - Fully validated datasets
  - Database-ready structure
  - Derived metrics included

Each subfolder is organized by research method (benthic, fish, bruvs, edna, etc.)

## secondary/

Data from external sources relevant to the expedition:

- **previous-work/**: Previous research
- **spatial/**: Habitat maps, administrative boundaries

:::

#### `documents/`

## Projects

The projects folder houses focused research initiatives and scientific papers that advance our mission. These may span global, regional, or expedition-specific contexts. Projects are given unique descriptive names that reflect their focus and objectives.

::: {.callout-note title="**Project ID**" appearance="minimal"}
Each project uses a standardized folder naming convention:

**Format**: prj-[descriptive]-[name]

**Examples:** `prj-SLI-resilience`, `prj-cachalote`, `prj-hawaii-lwr`
:::

### Structure

A typical project structure contains the following folders:

```
projects/
└── prj-[descriptive]-[name]/
    ├── data/              # Project data (may link to but not copy expedition data)
    ├── documents/         # Reference documents, meeting notes,
    ├── figures/           # Plots, maps, visualizations
    └── presentations/     # Project presentations
```

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal" title="GitHub Integration"}
### Code Management Policy

All code and scripts must be stored **exclusively** in GitHub repositories, never in Google Drive.

- Drive: Documents, data, media, and presentations
- GitHub: All code, scripts, and computational workflows

### Repository Naming Conventions

- **Expeditions**: `exp-[iso3]-[year]` (e.g., `exp-MDV-2023`)
- **Projects**: `prj-[descriptive]-[name]` (e.g., `prj-cachalote`)

This clear separation ensures proper version control, enables code review, facilitates collaboration, and maintains the integrity of our scientific workflow.
