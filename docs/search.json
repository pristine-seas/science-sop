    "text": "Survey Structure\n\nSites\nEach underwater visual survey location is designated as a site. Sites form the primary organizational unit for our surveys and are carefully selected to represent the full range of marine environments within the study area.\nSite Selection Criteria:\n\nHabitat representation: Major habitat types present in the region (e.g., forereef, lagoon, backreef)\nExposure gradient: From protected/sheltered to exposed locations\nProtection status: Both inside and outside protected areas when applicable\nCommunity input: Locations identified by local knowledge as important\nAccessibility: Practical considerations for safe dive operations\n\n\n\nStations\nEach site contains stations at different depths to capture vertical zonation patterns. Typically, two depths are surveyed at each site and the specific depths surveyed depend on local bathymetry, habitat distribution, and research priorities. In some locations, only one depth strata may be present or accessible. In this cases, the team may double the sampling effort at the single station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard UVS depth strata\n\n\n\nEvery survey station is assigned to one of three standardized depth strata with corresponding suffixes that build the station label:\nDepth strata and suffixes:\n\nSupershallow (≤ 6 m) → 05m\n\nShallow (7–14 m) → 10m\n\nDeep (≥ 15 m) → 20m\n\nStation ID structure: [ISO3]_[YEAR]_uvs_[SITE]_[Depth_suffix]\nExamples:\n\nFirst survey of Fiji’s 2025 expedition at 5.8 m → FJI_2025_uvs_001_05m\nFirst survey of Fiji’s 2025 expedition at 12 m → FJI_2025_uvs_001_10m\n\nThis scheme ensures consistent stratification across all analyses, even with natural variation in survey depth.\n\n\n\n\nTransects\nAt each station, survey methods use multiple standardized transects at consistent depth contours to derive robust station averages. These function as pseudoreplicates rather than independent samples, improving precision and accounting for small-scale spatial variation. Detailed specifications are provided in each method’s dedicated section.",

When a point lands on coral, the benthic diver marks it as “Hard coral” (or “Hard coral - bleached”) without species identification.\nCoral diver: Focuses specifically on identifying all corals to species level at points previously marked as “Hard coral” by the benthic diver.\n\nThis division of labor ensures both broad coverage of all substrate types and precise taxonomic resolution for corals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLPI Transect Specifications\n\n\n\n\nLength: 50 meters (Note: transects may be shorter due to time or decompression constraints)\nDirection: Parallel to shoreline\nDepth strata: Constant (±1 m) standard depth strata (~5, 10 or 20 m)\nPoints: Sampled every 20 cm (250 points total)\nSections: Transects are divided into sections (5 of 10 m each)\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Procedure\n\nTransect deployment:\n\nDeploy transect tape parallel to shoreline\nMaintain consistent depth throughout\nSecure ends to maintain straight line\n\nPoint sampling:\n\nSample at 20 cm intervals along the transect (250 points total)\nRecord what lies directly beneath each point\nBenthic diver identifies all non-coral points to lowest taxonomic level\nCoral diver identifies coral points to species level\n\nBleaching assessment:\n\nFor hard corals: differentiate between healthy, bleaching, and dead colonies\nFor soft corals: distinguish bleached and non-bleached colonies\n\nPhoto documentation:\n\nTake overview photo of transect\nPhotograph representative points\nDocument unusual or unidentified organisms\n\nExplore:\n\nRoam the station if time allows\nDocument any notable off-transect taxa or observations",

Example: “blue branching coral,” “tall green algae,” “orange encrusting sponge”\nMorphotaxa: Field names are refined into preliminary taxonomic units that combine formal taxonomy with distinguishing field characteristics. This process begins onboard the expedition vessel and evolves as divers gain familiarity with local taxa. Example: “Acropora sp. blue,” “Halimeda sp. tall,” “Clathria sp. orange”\nLowest Defensible Taxonomic Rank: The lowest taxonomic level that can be scientifically defended based on visual identification and available evidence.

Darling et al. (2012) identified four globally consistent strategies across 143 coral species through hierarchical clustering and random forests analyses, primarily distinguished by colony morphology, growth rate, and reproductive mode. These strategies help predict species responses to disturbances and inform conservation approaches in the rapidly changing marine environment.\n\nCompetitiveWeedyStress-TolerantGeneralist\n\n\nTraits: Fast growth (&gt;15 cm/year), broadcast spawning, large colonies with low skeletal density.

    "text": "Data Processing\n\nData Entry\nLPI data are entered into standardized Excel fieldbooks that are store in the ship’s NAS with the following structure:\n\nreadme sheet: Contains expedition info, data entry instructions, and guidelines\nstations sheet: Records station information including sampling depths, survey lengths, and any deviations from protocol.\nobservations sheet: Primary data entry for all LPI point intercepts\n\n\n\nProcessing Pipeline\n\nFile Consolidation\nThe workflow begins by reading all expedition fieldbooks across legs and divers, combining stations and observations into a unified dataset. This includes converting the data from a wide format (best for data entry in the field) to a long data format, best for anaysis and visualiztion. It also include merginbg the work of the benthic and coral divers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerging Benthic and Coral Diver Data\n\n\n\nThis critical step integrates the specialized knowledge of both divers:\n\nBenthic diver identifies functional groups (e.g., “30 points as hard coral”)\nCoral diver provides detailed taxonomic identification of corals\nWe apportion the benthic diver’s points based on the coral diver’s proportional observations\nThis maintains accurate functional group counts while maximizing taxonomic resolution\n\n\n\n\n\nValidation and Cleaning\nStation data is joined with the uvs_sites_fieldbook to validate site information including coordinates, habitat type, and spatial hierarchy. We check depth strata alignment across stations, standardizes formats, and verifies completeness of required fields. Transects are validated to confirm they contain the expected number of points, with exceptions flagged for review.\nAll taxonomic entries undergo validation against master reference lists, with morphotaxa mapped to the appropriate classification hierarchy.\n\n\nBenthic Cover Calculation\nFrom the cleaned data, we calculate percent cover by morphotaxa and functional group for each station. Additional metrics include species richness, diversity indices, and coral health indicators such as bleaching percentages. These station-level calculations are then aggregated to create site averages and region-wide metrics for comparative analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore Output Files\n\n\n\nThe pipeline generates four essential files:\n\nlpi_count: raw but clean raw point contacts\nlpi_cover_by_taxa: total points and % cover by morphotaxa and station\nlpi_station_summary: % cover by functional category and station\nlpi_taxa_summary.csv: prevalence across regions, frequency of occurrence, and average cover values\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Integration\nFinally, the processed data is formatted for database ingestion with appropriate metadata tags and quality indicators. This standardized approach ensures consistent data structure across expeditions, facilitating long-term monitoring and comparative analysis of marine ecosystems worldwide.\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nAfter completion of the data processing pipeline, we employ a separate eda.qmd file to conduct standardized yet flexible exploratory analyses. This approach balances consistency across expeditions with the need for location-specific insights.\nOur EDA workflow includes several core analyses that we produce for every expedition:\nBiodiversity Assessment - Species accumulation curves to evaluate sampling adequacy - Diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson) compared across sites - Species rank-abundance distributions to characterize community structure\nStatistical Comparisons - Tests for significant differences in diversity and cover metrics - Analyses stratified by region, habitat type, and depth - Focus on key functional groups (hard corals, macroalgae, cyanobacteria)\nCommunity Composition - Multivariate analyses of benthic communities (NMDS, cluster analysis) - Visualization of functional group proportions using consistent color palettes - Identification of indicator species for different habitat types\nCoral Health - Bleaching prevalence by species and depth - Disease incidence and severity metrics\nSpatial Visualization - Interactive maps of survey sites with embedded metrics - Geographic pattern analysis",

    "text": "Limitations\nWhile the Line Point Intercept (LPI) method offers efficiency and standardization for coral reef monitoring, several methodological trade-offs warrant consideration:\n\nPoint spacing\nSome research suggests 20cm intervals may be too close. Studies comparing intervals found 50cm spacing reduces survey time while still detecting major cover trends, though at the cost of potentially missing rarer species (Facon et al., 2016; Kuo et al., 2022). Statistical power analyses indicate substantially larger sample sizes than typically used are needed to detect even moderate changes in cover regardless of spacing (Leujak & Ormond, 2007).\n\n\nTransect length\nThe standard 50m transect represents a compromise between survey effort and habitat representation. Multiple shorter transects often provide better representation of reef spatial heterogeneity than fewer longer ones (Vallès et al., 2019). Linear methods inherently sample only a tiny proportion of reef area compared to quadrat approaches (0.33% vs 17.8% in some studies).\n\n\nAlternative methods\nFor bleaching assessment specifically, quadrat methods have demonstrated advantages in capturing colony-level impacts and detecting more species than point methods (Brown et al., 2015; Coral Reef Alliance, 2024). Belt transects provide a reasonable compromise for characterizing both coral cover and condition. We continue using LPI methods for consistency with historical data while acknowledging these limitations in our analyses and reports.",
