    "text": "Survey Structure\n\nSites\nEach underwater visual survey location is designated as a site. Sites form the primary organizational unit for our surveys and are carefully selected to represent the full range of marine environments within the study area.\nSite Selection Criteria:\n\nHabitat representation: Major habitat types present in the region (e.g., forereef, lagoon, backreef)\nExposure gradient: From protected/sheltered to exposed locations\nProtection status: Both inside and outside protected areas when applicable\nCommunity input: Locations identified by local knowledge as important\nAccessibility: Practical considerations for safe dive operations\n\n\n\nStations\nEach site contains stations at different depths to capture vertical zonation patterns. Typically, two depths are surveyed at each site and the specific depths surveyed depend on local bathymetry, habitat distribution, and research priorities. In some locations, only one depth strata may be present or accessible. In this cases, the team may double the sampling effort at the single station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard UVS depth strata\n\n\n\nEvery survey station is assigned to one of three standardized depth strata with corresponding suffixes that build the station label:\nDepth strata and suffixes:\n\nSupershallow (≤ 6 m) → 05m\n\nShallow (7–14 m) → 10m\n\nDeep (≥ 15 m) → 20m\n\nStation ID structure: [ISO3]_[YEAR]_uvs_[SITE]_[Depth_suffix]\nExamples:\n\nFirst survey of Fiji’s 2025 expedition at 5.8 m → FJI_2025_uvs_001_05m\nFirst survey of Fiji’s 2025 expedition at 12 m → FJI_2025_uvs_001_10m\n\nThis scheme ensures consistent stratification across all analyses, even with natural variation in survey depth.\n\n\n\n\nTransects\nAt each station, survey methods use multiple standardized transects at consistent depth contours to derive robust station averages. These function as pseudoreplicates rather than independent samples, improving precision and accounting for small-scale spatial variation. Detailed specifications are provided in each method’s dedicated section.",

Maintained by the dive team lead, it serves as the authoritative source for cross-referencing UVS datasets and ensuring data consistency.\nDaily records include:\n\nLocation Details: Region, subregion, locality, site name\n\nAccurate Coordinates: GPS coordinates (WGS84)\n\nSite Conditions: Habitat type and exposure level\n\nProtocol Completion: Survey methods executed and any deviations noted\n\nField Notes: Notable observations, incidents, and contextual informatio\n\nAll habitat types and exposure levels must be recorded using the controlled vocabulary specified below. This standardization is critical for understanding ecological patterns, enabling comparisons across sites, and assessing habitat-specific community structure and condition.\n\nHabitat types\nThis vocabulary standardizes the classification of benthic environments encountered during underwater visual surveys. It includes coral reef zones, temperate habitats, and other dominant seafloor types relevant to ecological analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabitats\n\n\n\nHabitat\n\nfore_reef — Seaward-facing outer slope of coral reef\n\nback_reef — Lagoon-facing side behind the reef crest\n\nreef_flat — Horizontal shallow zone near the crest\n\npatch_reef — Isolated reef outcrop within lagoon or sand plain\n\npinnacle_reef — Steep-sided, often isolated coral structures\n\nbank — Flat-topped offshore feature with reef or rocky habitat\nrocky_reef — Non-coral reef formed from rock, with reef biota\n\nreef_pavement — Flat, low-relief hard-bottom reef surface\n\nchannel_pass — Channel through reef system with strong flow\n\nwall — Vertical or steep reef drop-off\n\nkelp_forest — Dense canopy-forming macroalgae habitat\n\nseagrass — Dominant seagrass bed habitat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure\nThis classification describes the hydrodynamic setting of a site, based on relative exposure to wave energy, swell, or current. It helps interpret ecological patterns linked to environmental forcing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure\n\n\n\nExposure\n\nwindward — Exposed to prevailing swell or wind; typically high wave energy and surge\n\nleeward — Sheltered side of reef or island protected from prevailing swell\n\nlagoon — Located inside a reef or atoll, generally protected from direct wave action\n\nchannel — Within a reef pass or surge channel; often features strong tidal currents\n\nsheltered — Protected from wave energy by a bay or other geomorphic feature\n\nexposed — Generally high energy due to wave or swell exposure; used where windward/leeward doesn’t apply\n\nunknown — Exposure not determined or insufficient data to classify\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection\nThe dive team lead is responsible for recording the protection status of each UVS site in the fieldbook. This information is critical for evaluating the conservation context of survey data and assessing MPA effectiveness, particularly for small local MPAs. We record protection status using two fields:\n\nin_mpa: Indicates whether the site is within a protected area (e.g., MPA, no-take zone) or not.\nmpa_notes: A free-text field to specify the MPA name, protection type (e.g., no-take, seasonal closure), and any local or jurisdictional notes.\n\n\n\n\nPhotographic records\nPhotographic documentation is a core component of the UVS methodology. It provides visual evidence to support species identification, habitat classification, and ecological assessments.\nEach diver is responsible for capturing clear, high-quality images and delivering two outputs:\n\nComplete photo set: All images, organized in folders by station ID, following standard file naming conventions.\nCurated selection: A subset of the best images, labeled with species names, habitat types, or notable observations. These images are intended for reference libraries, reports, and outreach materials.\n\nRefer to the Media Management section for detailed guidance on file naming conventions, metadata standards, and best practices for imagery organization and submission.\n\n\nQuality Assurance Procedures\nTo maintain data integrity across all UVS methods, we implement these key quality control measures:\nSame-Day Data Entry\nRecord all observations immediately after diving while details remain fresh and accurate\nDaily QAQC Review\nSave data to the ship’s NAS for quality checks, including mapping of survey sites to check accuracy and inform planning\nSpecies Verification\nConfirm identifications using photographic evidence and our physical and digital reference library\nTaxonomic Standardization\nMinimize taxonomic errors by using the team’s taxonomic reference list for consistent species identification and database linkage\nSource Documentation\nArchive original field datasheets securely for future reference and verification\nCross-Referenced Records\nEnsure consistency by validating all method-specific data against the UVS Sites Fieldbook",

This classification system provides a foundation for analyzing reef community structure and ecosystem function.\n\nTrophic Groups\nWe use five primary trophic categories that reflect feeding ecology and position in the food web:\n\n\n\nHerbivore/Detritivore Species that primarily consume plant material or detritus Examples: Parrotfishes (Scaridae), surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), rabbitfishes (Siganidae)\n\n\n\nPlanktivore Species that primarily consume planktonic organisms Examples: Fusiliers (Caesionidae), chromis (Pomacentridae), anthias (Anthiadinae)\n\n\n\nLower-Carnivore Species that consume mainly invertebrates and small fishes Examples: Wrasses (Labridae), snappers (Lutjanidae), emperors (Lethrinidae)\n\n\n\nTop-Predator Non-shark predatory species primarily consuming other fishes Examples: Groupers (Epinephelidae), barracuda (Sphyraenidae), jacks (Carangidae)\n\n\n\nShark All sharks, regardless of feeding ecology Examples: Reef sharks (Carcharhinidae), nurse sharks (Ginglymostomatidae), hammerheads (Sphyrnidae)\n\n\n\nThese categories allow us to analyze trophic structure across reef ecosystems and assess the impacts of fishing pressure, which typically affects top predators and sharks first, followed by lower trophic levels.\n\n\nHerbivore Functional Groups\nHerbivorous fishes play critical roles in coral reef resilience by controlling algae that compete with corals. We further classify herbivores into four functional groups based on their feeding mode:\n\n\n\nBrowsers Selectively feed on macroalgae, removing entire plants Examples: Naso unicornis, many Kyphosus species\n\n\n\nGrazers Crop algal turf, creating patches of cropped substrate Examples: Many Acanthurus species, Zebrasoma\n\n\n\nScrapers Remove algae and associated sediment and detritus Examples: Many Scarinae (parrotfishes)\n\n\n\nExcavators Remove chunks of substrate while feeding, creating space for coral recruitment Examples: Large-bodied Scarinae, Chlorurus species\n\n\n\nThis functional classification enables detailed analysis of how different types of herbivores contribute to reef processes, particularly coral-algal dynamics and reef recovery potential after disturbances.",

    "section": "Data Workflow",
    "text": "Data Workflow\nThe Pristine Seas fish survey methodology follows a systematic workflow from field collection to analysis, ensuring data quality and scientific rigor at each stage.\n\nData Entry\nFish survey data are recorded on underwater slates during dives and transferred to standardized Excel fieldbooks on the same day. This immediate transcription preserves data accuracy while memories are fresh. The ISO3_YEAR_fish_fieldbook.xlsx serves as the primary data repository for each expedition with four key components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFieldbook Structure\n\n\n\n\nReadme: Expedition details, data entry protocols, and guidelines\nStations: Site information including depth, survey effort, and habitat type\nObservations: Individual fish records with taxonomic codes, counts, and size estimates\nSpecies: Reference list of fish species with taxonomic information\n\n\n\nThe observations sheet includes built-in validation rules that flag potential errors such as:\n\nSpecies codes not in the reference list\nSize estimates exceeding known maximum lengths\nMissing or inconsistent data fields\n\nThis real-time validation enables immediate correction while field observations remain clear in divers’ memories.\n\n\nProcessing Pipeline\nOur data processing transforms raw field observations into analysis-ready datasets through four sequential phases:\n\n1. Consolidation and Standardization\nFirst, we combine data from multiple divers and expedition legs into a unified dataset:\n\nConvert field codes to accepted scientific names and AphiaIDs\nStandardize size measurements and abundance records\nAdd spatial metadata from the site documentation\nJoin species traits from the taxonomy.fish reference table using AphiaID\nCreate a complete dataset that preserves all original observations\n\n\n\n2. Quality Control\nNext, we verify data quality through a systematic review process:\n\nAnalyze length distributions to identify unlikely size measurements\nCompare species lists between divers and stations for consistency\nCheck geographic ranges against known species distributions\nVerify taxonomic classifications against global databases\n\nPotential issues are flagged for expert review rather than automatically removed, preserving data integrity while ensuring scientific accuracy.\n\n\n3. Biomass Calculation\nWe then transform fish lengths into biomass estimates using the standard length-weight relationship:\n\\[W = a \\times L^b\\]\nWhere \\(W\\) is weight in grams, \\(L\\) is total length in centimeters, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are species-specific constants from our reference database. For species without specific parameters, we use coefficients from closely related species or family-level relationships.\nA critical step in this process is the addition of zero values for species that were not observed on a particular transect but are known to occur in the region. This ensures that absence data is properly incorporated into average calculations, preventing biased estimates of abundance and biomass. Zero values are applied:\n\nAfter taxonomic standardization but before aggregation\nBased on the regional species pool for each location\nOnly for species that could reasonably occur in the sampled habitat type\nPrior to calculating transect-level and station-level metrics\n\nThis process generates standardized metrics including:\n\nFish abundance (individuals/m²) by species and functional group\nBiomass (g/m²) at various taxonomic and ecological levels\nCommunity structure indicators like diversity indices\n\n\n\n4. Database Integration\nFinally, we format the processed data for ingestion into our central database, creating four core output files:\n\nblt_observations: Individual-level records with taxonomic classification and biomass\nblt_biomass_by_taxa: Abundance and biomass aggregated by species and station\nblt_stations: Site-level metadata and summary statistics\nblt_taxa_summary: Regional patterns of occurrence, abundance, and biomass\n\nThese standardized outputs allow consistent analysis across expeditions and regions while maintaining connections to the original field observations.\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nOur analysis examines fish communities through multiple complementary perspectives:\n\nCommunity Structure\nWe analyze biodiversity patterns through various metrics including:\n\nSpecies richness and diversity indices\nCommunity composition visualizations (NMDS, cluster analysis)\nDominant species identification and rank-abundance patterns\n\nThese analyses provide insights into ecosystem complexity and community organization at different sites.\n\n\nBiomass and Trophic Organization\nWe examine how biomass is distributed across trophic levels to understand ecosystem function. Key analyses include:\n\nProportional biomass of different trophic groups\nContribution of top predators and sharks to total fish biomass\nComparison with baseline values from remote, unfished locations\nAssessment of key species for local economies and food security\n\nThese patterns reveal fishing impacts and help evaluate ecosystem integrity.\n\n\nSize Structure\nFish size distributions provide insights into population health and fishing pressure:\n\nLength-frequency distributions for target species\nMean size comparisons across protection levels\nSize spectra analysis to detect fishing impacts\nGrowth and recruitment pattern assessment\n\nSize structure analysis is particularly valuable for identifying overfishing signals and evaluating protection effectiveness.\n\n\nSpatial Patterns\nBy analyzing how fish communities vary across space, we identify:\n\nBiomass hotspots and priority conservation areas\nHabitat associations for key species\nDepth-related changes in community structure\nEnvironmental correlates of fish distribution\n\n\n\nCross-Method Integration\nWe combine fish data with other survey components to reveal ecosystem relationships:\n\nCorrelations between coral cover and fish diversity/abundance\nRelationships between herbivorous fish and algal communities\nConnections between benthic habitat complexity and fish biomass\nPotential trophic cascades linking predators, herbivores, and reef algae\n\nThese integrated analyses provide a holistic understanding of reef ecosystem function and reveal the ecological processes that drive reef health and resilience.\nThrough these complementary analytical approaches, we transform field observations into ecological insights that inform conservation planning and contribute to our understanding of marine ecosystems—from individual reefs to global patterns.",

Every observation is documented following standardized protocols to ensure that data is consistent and reliable. We emphasize:\n\nStandardized fieldbooks specifically designed for each method, ensuring structured and error-free data collection.\nConsistent recording of site IDs, coordinates, date, time, and observer names for traceability.\nCommon terminology for habitat types, substrates, and species to maintain comparability across sites.\nPhoto documentation as visual evidence to complement written records.\nSystematic sampling methods that allow data to be compared confidently across different regions.\n\nThese protocols not only enhance the reliability of our own analysis but also make our data easily understandable and usable by other researchers working with us.\n\n\nData Entry\nOnce collected, data is entered into digital formats as soon as possible to prevent loss of detail and reduce errors. Our main practices include:\n\nSame-day data entry to keep information fresh and accurate.\nFieldbooks with built-in error checks to minimize typos and formatting mistakes.\nStandardized file naming: [ISO3]_[YEAR]_[METHOD]_fieldbook.xlsx for easy identification.\nReal-time backups on the ship’s storage system (NAS) to prevent data loss.\nDaily review by a data manager to spot errors early and maintain data quality.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that as more researchers join our efforts, everyone has access to clean, well-organized data that is easy to interpret and integrate across projects. It is our commitment to scientific rigor and transparency.\n\n\nMedia Management\nPhotos and videos serve as both scientific evidence and powerful tools for communicating our work. Consistent management ensures these visual assets remain accessible, properly labeled, and scientifically valuable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Management Best Practices\n\n\n\nGood photo management is essential for documenting our scientific work. Follow these three key practices:\n\nOrganize by Station: Keep all photos in folders organized by station ID so they can be easily found later\nSelect Best Images: Create a collection of high-quality, labeled photos showing species, notable observations, and habitats for our reference library and reports\nUse Consistent Names: Follow our standard naming approach for folders and important images\n\nFolders: [ISO3]-[YEAR]-[METHOD]-[STATION_ID]\nExamples:\n\nQuadrats: data/benthos/recruits/quadrats/PLW-2023-uvs-001-20m/\nFish: data/fish/photos/PLW-2023-uvs-001-20m/\nInverts: data/benthos/inverts/photos/PLW-2023-uvs-001-10m/\nBirds: data/birds/photos/PLW-2023-birds-001/\n\nSelected Images: [ISO3]_[YEAR]_[METHOD]_[STATION_ID]_[DESCRIPTION].jpg\nExamples:\n\nBirds: media/science-collection/birds/PLW_2023_birds_001_frigatebird.jpg\nFish: media/science-collection/fish/PLW_2023_uvs_001_20m_acanthurus_lineatus.jpg\nSubmersible: media/science-collection/sub/PLW_2023_sub_08_gorgonian_fan.jpg\n\nField Photos: Only selected highlights need complete labels; other field photos can remain as-is if stored in properly labeled station folders\nExamples:\n\nQuadrats: data/benthos/recruits/quadrats/PLW-2023-uvs-001-20m/q3_IMG0042.jpg\nBirds: data/birds/photos/PLW-2023-birds-001/canon_2023-08-01_12-00-00.jpg\n\n\n\nSave all photos to the NAS daily. The data manager will transfer everything to Google Drive after the expedition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Footage Best Practices\n\n\n\nManaging footage from remote cameras (BRUVS, deep-sea cameras, ROV, submersible) requires organization to make the most of these valuable recordings. Follow these key practices:\n\nUse a Central Highlights Folder: Save all important video clips and screenshots to the appropriate method’s highlights folder\n\nExamples:\n\nSeabed BRUVS: sbruv/highlights/\nPelagic BRUVS: pbruv/highlights/\nROV: rov/highlights/\nSubmersible: sub/highlights/\nDeep-sea cameras: deepsea/highlights/\n\n\nName Files Consistently: Use our standard format for all highlight files\n\nStandard Format: [ISO3]_[YEAR]_[METHOD]_[STATION_ID]_[DEPTH]_[DESCRIPTION].mp4\nExamples:\n\nSeabed BRUVS: FJI_2025_sbruv_001_40m_grouper_school.mp4\nPelagic BRUVS: FJI_2025_pbruv_003_silky_shark.mp4\nROV: FJI_2025_rov_002_350m_soft_coral_garden.mp4\nSubmersible: FJI_2025_sub_005_800m_deep_reef_community.mp4\nDeep-sea camera: FJI_2025_dscm004_1200m_cusk_eel.mp4\n\n\nUse Standard File Formats: Make sure everyone can open and view your files\n\nVideo Clips: Save as .mp4 format for all video highlights\nScreenshots: Save as .jpg format for all still images\nClip Length: Keep highlight clips between 10-60 seconds\nResolution: Maintain 1080p resolution\n\nInclude Important Details: Make sure others can understand what they’re seeing\n\nInclude depth information for all depth-related methods\nUse descriptive names that indicate content (species, behavior, habitat)\nNote the time code from original footage when possible\n\nCapture These Key Moments:\n\nDiversity and MaxN: Footage showing multiple species or high numbers\nBehaviors: Interesting activities like feeding, schooling, or cleaning\nHabitats: Good examples of different habitat types\nNotable Finds: Rare species, unusual interactions, or new records\n\n\nSave all highlight files to the NAS daily. The data manager will transfer everything to Google Drive after the expedition.\n\n\nWhile more detailed guidelines can be found in the Media Library section, these practices ensure that our photos and videos are properly organized and can be easily connected to our scientific observations.\n\n\nProcessing Pipeline\nWe use method-specific standardized scripts (pipeline_[method].qmd) to transform raw field observations into clean, analysis-ready datasets. Although each method follows a unique pipeline, the overall structure remains consistent, ensuring data integrity, traceability, and seamless integration into the Pristine Seas Science Database.\n\nData Ingestion and Harmonization\n\nData Ingestion: Gather and merge raw field data from multiple expedition legs and contributors.\nStandardization: Apply consistent field names, units, and formats to match database schema.\nSpatial Context: Harmonize geographic data across the established hierarchy:\n\nRegion → Subregion → Locality → Site → Station\n\nTerminology Alignment: Enforce consistent language for habitats, strata, and exposure types.\n\n\n\nQA/QC\n\nSampling Effort Verification: Assess completeness and alignment with sampling protocols.\nExploratory Visualizations: Generate maps and plots to visually inspect patterns.\nSpatial and Temporal Validation: Check station alignment and method overlap across regions.\nData Completeness Assessment: Identify missing values and ensure records are logically complete.\nOutlier and Anomaly Detection: Flag improbable values and check for inconsistencies.\nProtocol Deviation Documentation: Record any departures from standard field protocols.\n\n\n\nTaxonomic Validation\n\nSpecies Identification Checks: Cross-reference observed taxa with the Pristine Seas Taxonomic Database.\nResolve Inconsistencies: Correct synonyms, misidentifications, and hierarchical misalignments.\nHarmonize Across Regions: Ensure consistent naming and classification throughout the dataset.\n\n\n\nEcological Metric Calculation\n\nCompute key ecological indicators at relevant spatial scales:\n\nBiomass (g/m²)\nSpecies Richness\nDiversity Indices (e.g., Shannon, Simpson)\nTrophic Composition\nMaxN (Maximum Number Observed Simultaneously)\n\nGenerate summary tables at multiple ecological and political levels:\n\nTaxa → Station → Site → Subregion → Region\n\nProduce both detailed observation-level tables and summary statistics for downstream analyses.\n\n\n\nOutput Standardization and Database Integration\n\nFile Naming Convention: Apply a consistent format for traceability:\n\n[ISO3]_[YEAR]_[METHOD]_[TYPE].csv\nExamples: PLW_2023_fish_observations.csv, FJI_2025_coral_cover.csv\n\nDatabase Upload: Load processed and validated datasets into the Pristine Seas Science Database.\nMedia Linkage: Attach relevant photos and video highlights for cross-referencing.\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nThe Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage transforms standardized datasets into actionable insights that inform scientific reports and conservation strategies. During this phase, we go beyond surface-level exploration to actively seek indicators of ecosystem health, conservation effectiveness, and environmental threats. Analyses are performed in eda_[method].qmd, with a strong emphasis on generating meaningful ecological narratives and identifying conservation priorities.\n\nData Visualization\n\nCreate maps, summary plots, and interactive visualizations to reveal spatial and temporal patterns.\nGenerate summary statistics for key ecological metrics:\n\nBiomass, species richness, diversity indices, and trophic composition.\n\nVisualize ecological gradients across depth, region, and habitat types.\nExplore habitat-specific assemblages and species distributions to detect community shifts.\n\n\n\nContextual Analysis and Ecological Inference\n\nCompare findings across regions, depth strata, and time periods to identify ecological shifts.\nIntegrate results from multiple survey methods to build a comprehensive view of ecosystem dynamics.\nContextualize observations with known baselines, historical data, and previous expeditions.\nDetect range extensions, new records, and unusual species aggregations.\n\n\n\nConservation Insights\nDuring EDA, we explicitly explore key indicators that reflect ecosystem health, resilience, and human impact. This stage is conservation-driven, aiming to identify both risks and successes:\n\nEcosystem Health Indicators\n\nAssess reef health, predator biomass ratios, and trophic balance as indicators of ecosystem stability.\nIdentify keystone species and their relative abundance to understand ecosystem structure.\n\n\n\nOverfishing Evidence\n\nDetect declines in critical species, particularly large-bodied predators and apex species.\nMonitor shifts in size structure and age classes, signaling fishing pressure.\n\n\n\nClimate Change Impacts\n\nLook for signs of coral bleaching, range shifts, and changes in species composition.\nInvestigate sensitive species loss.\n\n\n\nHabitat Degradation\n\nExplore shifts in benthic cover, including macroalgae dominance, cyanobacteria blooms, and reductions in coral cover.\nIdentify areas with increasing sedimentation or evidence of physical damage (e.g., fishing lines).\n\n\n\nConservation Success Signals\n\nHighlight regions with high biomass, top predator abundance, and balanced trophic structures.\nIdentify MPA effectiveness by comparing protected versus unprotected areas.\n\n\n\nCritical Habitat Mapping\n\nMap species home ranges, migration corridors, and nursery areas.\nIdentify biodiversity hotspots and regions of ecological significance for conservation planning.",

    "text": "Data Workflow\n\nData Entry\nInvertebrate observations are recorded on underwater slates during dives and transferred to standardized Excel fieldbooks on the same day. This immediate transcription preserves data accuracy while memory is fresh. The ISO3_YEAR_inverts_fieldbook.xlsx serves as the primary data repository for each expedition with three key components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFieldbook Structure\n\n\n\n\nReadme: Expedition details, data entry protocols, and guidelines\nStations: Site information including depth, habitat type, and protocol adherence\nObservations: Individual invertebrate records with taxonomic identification, counts, and measurements\n\n\n\nThe observations sheet includes validation rules that flag potential errors such as:\n\nMissing taxonomic information\nUnlikely size measurements\nInvalid station numbers\n\n\n\nProcessing Pipeline\nOur data processing transforms raw field observations into analysis-ready datasets through four sequential phases:\n\n1. File Consolidation\nFirst, we compile data from all divers and expedition legs into a unified dataset:\n\nMerge all invertebrate records from multiple dives and sites\nStandardize taxonomic names using reference taxonomy lists\nAdd metadata from the UVS Sites Fieldbook (coordinates, habitat type, etc.)\nCreate a complete dataset that preserves all original observations\n\n\n\n2. Quality Control\nNext, we verify data quality through a systematic review process:\n\nValidate species identifications for consistency and accuracy\nFlag outliers in size measurements for review\nCross-check invertebrate records with habitat types for ecological coherence\nEnsure complete sampling coverage across all sites\n\nPotential issues are flagged for expert review rather than automatically removed, preserving data integrity while ensuring scientific accuracy.\n\n\n3. Density Calculation\nWe then calculate standardized density metrics for cross-site comparisons:\n\nCompute abundance per unit area (individuals/m²) for each taxon\nGenerate biomass estimates for species with established length-weight relationships\nCalculate summary statistics by taxonomic group, site, and region\n\nA critical step in this process is the addition of zero values for taxa that were not observed on a particular transect but were found elsewhere in the region. This ensures that absence data is properly incorporated when calculating average densities and prevents biased estimates. Zero values are applied:\n\nAfter taxonomic standardization but before aggregation\nBased on the regional species pool established for each survey\nOnly for species that could reasonably occur in the sampled habitat type\nPrior to calculating site-level and region-level metrics\n\n\n\n4. Database Integration\nFinally, we format the processed data for ingestion into our central database, creating four core output files:\n\ninverts_observations: Individual records with standardized taxonomy, counts, and measurements\ninverts_density_by_taxa: Density calculations by taxa and station\ninverts_stations: Station-level metadata and summary statistics (richness, density)\ninverts_taxa_summary: Regional occurrence patterns and average densities by taxa\n\nThese standardized outputs allow consistent analysis across expeditions and regions while maintaining connections to the original field observations.\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nOur analytical approach examines invertebrate communities through multiple complementary perspectives:\n\nCommunity Composition\nWe analyze biodiversity patterns and community structure:\n\nSpecies richness and diversity indices across sites and protection levels\nMultivariate analyses (NMDS, cluster analysis) to identify assemblage patterns\nFunctional group proportions to assess ecosystem processes\nIndicator species analysis to identify habitat associations\n\nThese analyses provide insights into the factors structuring invertebrate communities and their responses to environmental gradients.\n\n\nPopulation Patterns\nWe examine population characteristics of key species:\n\nDensity comparisons across sites, habitats, and protection levels\nSize frequency distributions to assess population structure\nBiomass estimates for commercially important species\nRecruitment patterns and juvenile abundance\n\nThese metrics help evaluate population health and the impacts of environmental conditions or harvesting pressure.\n\n\nSpatial Patterns\nBy analyzing invertebrate distributions across space, we identify:\n\nHotspots of diversity and abundance\nHabitat associations for key species\nDepth-related community changes\nGeographic patterns in commercially important taxa\n\nSpatial analyses provide critical information for conservation planning and resource management.\n\n\nCross-Method Integration\nWe combine invertebrate data with other survey components to reveal ecosystem relationships:\n\nCorrelations between benthic cover and invertebrate communities\nPredator-prey relationships between fish and invertebrates\nPotential impacts of invertebrate grazers on coral recruitment\nComparisons between visual surveys and eDNA detection of invertebrate diversity\n\nThese integrated analyses provide a holistic understanding of reef ecosystem function and reveal the ecological processes that drive reef health and resilience.\nThrough these complementary analytical approaches, we transform field observations into ecological insights that inform conservation planning and contribute to our understanding of marine ecosystems across multiple scales.",

The first time you run this code, you’ll be prompted to authenticate with your Google account.\n\n\nUsing dplyr Verbs\nThe real power comes from using familiar dplyr verbs directly with BigQuery tables—no SQL knowledge required:\n\ndf &lt;- tbl(bq_connection, \"taxonomy.fish\") |&gt; \n  group_by(family, genus) |&gt; \n  summarize(n_taxa = n_distinct(accepted_aphia_id),\n            .groups = \"drop\") |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n_taxa)) |&gt; \n  head(30) |&gt; \n  collect()\n  \ndf |&gt; \n  ggplot()+\n  geom_col(aes(x = fct_reorder(family, n_taxa, sum), \n               y = n_taxa, \n               fill = genus), \n           show.legend = T)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"# Distinct Taxa\", fill = \"\",\n       title = \"Number of fish taxa in taxonomy.fish table\",\n       subtitle = \"By family and genus\")+\n  paletteer::scale_fill_paletteer_d(\"ggsci::default_igv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes this approach powerful:\n\nBigQuery does the heavy lifting – All filtering, grouping, and summarizing happens in the database\nOnly results are transferred – Data never loads into memory until you call collect()\nFamiliar syntax – The same dplyr verbs you already use with local data frames\nReadable code – Complex queries expressed in clean, maintainable R code\n\n\n\n\nGoogle BigQuery Console\nThe database can also be accessed directly through the Google BigQuery Console:\n\nVisit console.cloud.google.com/bigquery\nNavigate to the pristine-seas project\nUse the query editor to write and execute SQL queries\nExplore tables, schemas, and query history\n\nThe console provides a user-friendly interface for exploring table structures, examining data samples, and running ad-hoc queries without writing code.\n\n\nAccess Management\nAccess to the Pristine Seas Science Database is managed through Google Cloud IAM:\n\nTeam Members: Full read access to all datasets\nCollaborators: Read access to specific datasets relevant to their work\nPartners: Access via shared exports or temporary read credentials\nPublic: Access to published, non-sensitive data via data packages (still TBD)\n\nTo request access, contact the database administrator with your Google account email and purpose.\n\n\nBest Practices\nWhen working with the Pristine Seas Science Database:\n\nMinimize data transfer: Filter data in BigQuery before collecting to R\nUse primary keys: Join tables using established keys (ps_station_id, ps_site_id)\nReproducible queries: Document your queries in Quarto documents\nAnalysis patterns: Build on established workflows in expedition repositories",

Pristine Seas employs a comprehensive taxonomic system that balances field practicality with scientific rigor, with the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) AphiaID serving as the authoritative identifier throughout all datasets.\n\nIdentification Process\nOur taxonomic approach adapts to the inherent challenges of identifying juvenile corals in the field. The most significant difficulty stems from the dramatic morphological differences between juvenile and adult coral colonies:\n\nUndeveloped morphology: Young colonies lack the characteristic growth forms that define adult corals\nLimited polyp development: Colonies often have only a few polyps, obscuring diagnostic features\nCryptic placement: Recruits frequently settle in concealed locations, complicating thorough examination\nDevelopmental plasticity: Early growth forms may differ substantially from adult morphology\n\nTo address these challenges, we implement a size-based hierarchical approach that matches identification precision to observable features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize-Based Identification Approach\n\n\n\nWe implement a hierarchical approach that matches identification precision to colony size and observable features:\nFor colonies smaller than 1 cm: Focus on basic skeletal structures and polyp arrangements, typically achieving family-level identification and sometimes genus-level when distinctive features are present.\nFor colonies between 1-3 cm: Incorporate tissue characteristics and emerging morphology, reliably achieving genus-level identification in most cases. Color patterns, polyp arrangement, and initial branching patterns become more distinctive.\nFor colonies between 3-5 cm: Apply standard adult coral identification criteria where applicable, enabling genus-level identification in nearly all cases and species-level identification when key diagnostic features are present.\n\n\nThroughout this process, photographic documentation supports field identifications, allowing for post-dive verification and consultation with coral taxonomy specialists when necessary. This systematic approach acknowledges the practical limitations of field identification while maximizing taxonomic precision at each developmental stage.",

The ISO3_YEAR_recruits_fieldbook.xlsx is organized as follows:\n\nreadme sheet: Contains expedition info, data entry instructions, and guidelines\nstations sheet: Records station information including sampling depths, habitat types, and any deviations from protocol\nrecruits sheet: Primary data entry for all coral recruits, including , size measurements and substrate type, and quadrat level info\n\nThe recruits sheet includes validation rules that flag potential errors such as:\n\nSize measurements exceeding the 5 cm maximum threshold\nMissing taxonomic information\nInvalid quadrat numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuadrat Image Organization\n\n\n\nThe systematic organization of quadrat images is essential for later reference and quality control:\n\nNaming convention: [ISO3]_[YEAR]_recruits_[SITE_ID]_[DEPTH]_Q[##].jpg\nExample: PLW_2023_recruits_005_10m_Q03.jpg (Palau, 2023, site 5, 10m depth, quadrat 3)\nStorage structure: Images stored in folders mirroring site → station hierarchy\nBackup protocol: Daily transfer to expedition NAS and cloud backup when possible\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing Pipeline\nOur data processing transforms raw field observations into analysis-ready datasets through:\n\n1. File Consolidation\nFirst, we compile data from all divers and expedition legs into a unified dataset:\n\nMerge all recruits records from multiple dives and sites\nStandardize taxonomic names using our coral taxonomy reference table\nAdd metadata from the UVS Sites Fieldbook (coordinates, habitat type, etc.)\nValidate image references and ensure all quadrats are properly documented\nCreate a complete dataset that preserves all original observations\n\n\n\n2. Quality Control\nNext, we verify data quality through a systematic review process:\n\nAnalyze size distributions to identify unlikely measurements\nCompare taxonomic identifications between observers for consistency\nCross-check recruit taxa against adult corals identified in LPI surveys\nVerify substrate categorizations for consistency\nEnsure complete sampling coverage (all 10 quadrats per transect)\n\nPotential issues are flagged for expert review rather than automatically removed, preserving data integrity while ensuring scientific accuracy.\n\n\n3. Density Calculation\nWe then calculate standardized density metrics for cross-site comparisons:\n\nCompute recruit density (colonies/m²) by taxa and size class\nAccount for the actual area sampled when fewer than 10 quadrats were completed\nGenerate density metrics at multiple taxonomic levels (species, genus, family)\nCalculate size-based metrics (mean diameter, size class frequencies)\n\nA critical step in this process is the addition of zero values for taxa that were not observed in a particular quadrat but were found elsewhere at the site.

    "text": "Data Workflow\n\nData Entry\nLPI data are recorded in standardized Excel fieldbooks on the same day of data collection, while information and memory are fresh. The ISO3_YEAR_lpi_fieldbook.xlsx is organized as follows:\n\nreadme sheet: Contains expedition info, data entry instructions, and guidelines\nstations sheet: Records station information including sampling depths, survey lengths, and any deviations from protocol.\nobservations sheet: Primary data entry for all LPI point intercepts\n\n\n\nProcessing Pipeline\n\nFile Consolidation\nThe workflow begins by reading all expedition fieldbooks across legs and divers, combining stations and observations into a unified dataset. This includes converting the data from a wide format (best for data entry in the field) to a long data format, best for anaysis and visualiztion. It also include merginbg the work of the benthic and coral divers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerging Benthic and Coral Diver Data\n\n\n\nThis critical step integrates the specialized knowledge of both divers:\n\nBenthic diver identifies functional groups (e.g., “30 points as hard coral”)\nCoral diver provides detailed taxonomic identification of corals\nWe apportion the benthic diver’s points based on the coral diver’s proportional observations\nThis maintains accurate functional group counts while maximizing taxonomic resolution\n\n\n\n\n\nValidation and Cleaning\nStation data is joined with the uvs_sites_fieldbook to validate site information including coordinates, habitat type, and spatial hierarchy. We check depth strata alignment across stations, standardizes formats, and verifies completeness of required fields. Transects are validated to confirm they contain the expected number of points, with exceptions flagged for review.\nAll taxonomic entries undergo validation against master reference lists, with morphotaxa mapped to the appropriate classification hierarchy.\n\n\nBenthic Cover Calculation\nFrom the cleaned data, we calculate percent cover by morphotaxa and functional group for each station. Additional metrics include species richness, diversity indices, and coral health indicators such as bleaching percentages. These station-level calculations are then aggregated to create site averages and region-wide metrics for comparative analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore Output Files\n\n\n\nThe pipeline generates four essential files:\n\nlpi_count: raw but clean raw point contacts\nlpi_cover_by_taxa: total points and % cover by morphotaxa and station\nlpi_station_summary: % cover by functional category and station\nlpi_taxa_summary.csv: prevalence across regions, frequency of occurrence, and average cover values\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Integration\nFinally, the processed data is formatted for database ingestion with appropriate metadata tags and quality indicators. This standardized approach ensures consistent data structure across expeditions, facilitating long-term monitoring and comparative analysis of marine ecosystems worldwide.\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nAfter completion of the data processing pipeline, we employ a separate eda.qmd file to conduct standardized yet flexible exploratory analyses. This approach balances consistency across expeditions with the need for location-specific insights.\nOur EDA workflow includes several core analyses that we produce for every expedition:\nBiodiversity Assessment - Species accumulation curves to evaluate sampling adequacy - Diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson) compared across sites - Species rank-abundance distributions to characterize community structure\nStatistical Comparisons - Tests for significant differences in diversity and cover metrics - Analyses stratified by region, habitat type, and depth - Focus on key functional groups (hard corals, macroalgae, cyanobacteria)\nCommunity Composition - Multivariate analyses of benthic communities (NMDS, cluster analysis) - Visualization of functional group proportions using consistent color palettes - Identification of indicator species for different habitat types\nCoral Health - Bleaching prevalence by species and depth - Disease incidence and severity metrics\nSpatial Visualization - Interactive maps of survey sites with embedded metrics - Geographic pattern analysis",

    "text": "Limitations\nWhile the Line Point Intercept (LPI) method offers efficiency and standardization for coral reef monitoring, several methodological trade-offs warrant consideration:\n\nPoint spacing\nSome research suggests 20cm intervals may be too close. Studies comparing intervals found 50cm spacing reduces survey time while still detecting major cover trends, though at the cost of potentially missing rarer species (Facon et al., 2016; Kuo et al., 2022). Statistical power analyses indicate substantially larger sample sizes than typically used are needed to detect even moderate changes in cover regardless of spacing (Leujak & Ormond, 2007).\n\n\nTransect length\nThe standard 50m transect represents a compromise between survey effort and habitat representation. Multiple shorter transects often provide better representation of reef spatial heterogeneity than fewer longer ones (Vallès et al., 2019). Linear methods inherently sample only a tiny proportion of reef area compared to quadrat approaches (0.33% vs 17.8% in some studies).\n\n\nAlternative methods\nFor bleaching assessment specifically, quadrat methods have demonstrated advantages in capturing colony-level impacts and detecting more species than point methods (Brown et al., 2015; Coral Reef Alliance, 2024). Belt transects provide a reasonable compromise for characterizing both coral cover and condition. We continue using LPI methods for consistency with historical data while acknowledging these limitations in our analyses and reports.",

    "text": "Method Overview\nSeabed BRUVS employ stereo-camera systems with standardized bait to attract and record fish, operating as autonomous underwater observatories. This approach provides relative abundance estimates and precise length measurements for all observed taxa\n\nFeatures\n\nHabitat versatility: Effective from shallow mangroves to deep reefs (5-70+ m)\nSubstrate adaptability: Functions on sand, mud, rubble, coral, and rocky bottoms\nCurrent tolerance: Operates in calm lagoons to high-flow reef passes\nPassive sampling: Eliminates diver-induced behavioral bias\nStereo cameras: Precise length measurements via calibrated camera separation\nStandardized bait: Consistent attraction stimulus across deployments\nExtended observation: Captures species with different response times to bait attraction\n\n\n\nKey metric\nThe fundamental measurement unit in BRUVS surveys is MaxN (Maximum Number): the highest count of individuals of a given species observed simultaneously in a single video frame during the entire deployment. MaxN provides a conservative, standardized abundance index that accounts for individual fish moving in and out of the camera’s field of view.\n\nEliminates double-counting of the same individuals\nProvides consistent abundance estimates across different deployment conditions\nEnables robust comparisons between sites, regions, and time periods\nRemains conservative when fish behavior varies"

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nWhile seabed BRUVS provide valuable standardized data on predatory fish assemblages, several methodological limitations should be acknowledged when interpreting results.\n\nSampling Bias\nBait Attraction Variability: Fish responses to bait vary significantly among species and individuals. Some species show strong positive attraction, others exhibit active avoidance, and territorial species may exclude other fish from the immediate area around the bait.\nSize and Behavioral Bias: Larger, more aggressive predators may dominate bait areas, potentially excluding smaller individuals or species. This can lead to underestimation of juvenile abundance and species that are less competitive around bait.\nTemporal Coverage: Standard 60-minute deployments provide only a brief snapshot of fish community activity. Species with different temporal activity patterns (dawn/dusk activity, tidal influences) may be missed or underrepresented.\n\n\nTechnical Limitations\nEnvironmental Dependency: Successful deployments require suitable sea conditions and stable substrate. Steep slopes, strong currents, poor visibility, or equipment failure can result in partial or complete data loss.\nDetection Limitations: MaxN provides minimum abundance estimates as individuals moving in and out of the camera’s field of view may not be detected simultaneously. Video quality affects species identification accuracy, particularly for smaller or more cryptic species.\n\n\nMethodological Considerations\nObserver Effect Elimination vs. Limited Behavior: While BRUVS eliminate diver effects, they may not capture natural feeding behaviors, territorial interactions, or species that don’t respond to bait stimulus.\nCommunity Representation: BRUVS excel at documenting predatory fish but systematically underrepresent small-bodied species, herbivores, and planktivores compared to visual surveys.\nStandardization Challenges: Variations in bait type, quantity, freshness, and local availability may affect comparability between deployments and regions.\n\n\nMitigation Strategies\nComplementary Methods: We integrate BRUVS with UVS, eDNA, and other techniques to provide comprehensive ecosystem assessment that accounts for each method’s strengths and biases.\nStandardized Protocols: Protocols for equipment preparation, deployment procedures, and data analysis ensure valid comparisons across sites and time periods.\nQuality Control: Multiple deployment replication, video quality assessment, and expert taxonomic review address technical and analytical sources of error.\nAppropriate Interpretation: Results are interpreted within the context of method-specific limitations, focusing on questions that BRUVS are well-suited to address: predator abundance, community structure, and fishing impacts."

    "text": "Field Implementation\n\nOperations Schedule\nBRUVS deployments are conducted using small boats (Zodiac or RHIB) with three rigs deployed per set, typically once or twice daily depending on site availability and conditions.\nDaily Workflow:\n\nMorning (7 AM - 12 PM): Primary deployments (1-2 three-rig sets)\nAfternoon (1-5 PM): Secondary deployments OR data processing and equipment maintenance\nEvening: Final data backup and next-day preparation\n\nTeam Structure:\n\nSmall boat crew: 2-3 person team including boat operator and BRUVS specialists\nSet duration: ~4-5 hours including deployment, 60-minute soak time, and recovery\nAutonomous operations: Independent of main vessel within communication range\n\n\n\nSite Selection\nBRUVS deployment sites are strategically selected based on habitat availability and practical deployment considerations:\nCoverage Strategy:\n\nHabitat extension: Access environments not sampled by divers (seagrass beds, channels, deep slopes)\nDepth extension: Survey beyond diver limits (&gt;20 m) to deeper reef slopes (up to 70+ m)\nGeographic coverage: Expand total survey area, particularly for large islands, atolls, or regions\n\nDeployment Considerations:\n\nSlope stability: Critical factor determining success—too steep and rigs slide into the abyss\nVisual reconnaissance: Direct observation by divers when possible to assess slope suitability\nOptimal positioning: Stable areas where frames settle securely without rolling or sliding\n\nIdeal Camera Orientation:\n\nFrame positioning: Bottom third captures reef substrate, upper two-thirds records open water\nCamera direction: Facing away from reef slope to maximize water column coverage\n\n\n\nDeployment Procedure\n\n1. Pre-Deployment Preparation\nCamera Setup (once per expedition):\nEstablishing consistent camera settings and synchronized date/time across all units at the expedition’s outset ensures data integrity and streamlines post-deployment analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera Settings\n\n\n\n\nVideo settings: 25-30 fps optimized for stereo-photogrammetric measurements\nResolution: 1080p for high-quality video capture\n\n\n\nDaily Preparation:\n\nInstall fresh batteries and empty SD cards in all cameras\nClean cameras and housings, removing any dirt or moisture\nPlace cameras in rigs with proper sealing verification\nAttach lights with fresh batteries to rigs (if deploying &gt;30m)\nSmash bait into perforated canisters and close securely\nEnsure deployment lines have enough scope at 1.5-2x target depth\n\nEquipment Loading:\nSystematic loading of the small boat ensures all essential components are aboard:\n\nBoat box: GPS, depth sounder, deployment logbook, tools and spares\nBait bucket: Freshly crushed bait into canisters\nBRUVS systems: Three complete rigs prepared for deployment\nDeployment gear: Lines, line buckets, surface buoys, and doodle board for camera synchronization\nRecovery equipment: Winch, battery, and essential tools\n\n\n\n2. Deployment Sequence\nUpon arrival at each potential deployment site, the team conducts a thorough assessment of bottom conditions before proceeding with deployment. Slope angle is a critical determining factor, as excessive steepness will cause rigs to slide into deeper water and drift away.\nOnce suitable substrate is confirmed, deployment proceeds through the following systematic steps:\n\nConnect deployment system: Secure the rig to its deployment line and surface buoy\nAttach fresh bait: Shake bait container for optimal scent dispersal and attach to the rig’s bait arm\nActivate cameras: Power on both cameras and verify recording status indicators\nSynchronize cameras: Use the doodle board to provide timing reference for stereo analysis with the following information:\n\nDate\nStation ID\nRig number\n\nDeploy to seabed: Position the small boat appropriately, then lower the rig steadily to the bottom\n\nMaintain careful attention to rig orientation during descent\nAim for optimal field of view configuration: bottom third captures reef substrate, upper two-thirds records open water column\n\nRecord position: Mark GPS waypoint and confirm actual deployment depth\nAssess stability: Evaluate current drift and surface buoy position before proceeding to the next site\n\n\n\n3. Recovery Operations\nAfter the 60-minute soak period, recovery operations begin with the retrieval of each rig. Approach each recovery site cautiously to minimize disturbance to any fish activity and prevent line entanglement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinch System\n\n\n\nRecovery operations use a portable electric winch powered by a marine-grade 12V battery. Connect and test the winch-battery system on the small boat before beginning recovery operations. The winch provides essential mechanical advantage for safe rig retrieval, particularly when dealing with current or equipment snags.\n\n\n\nSecure retrieval line: Load the buoy on the boat and connect the surface line to the winch system\nRetrieve rig: Use winch assistance to haul the rig steadily to the surface\n\nKeep boat positioned away from reef to minimize entanglement risk\nPosition boat directly over rig before activating winch\nCoordinate winch operation with boat positioning throughout retrieval\n\nRemove bait: Discard used bait container upon surfacing\nEquipment reset: Prepare rig for next deployment cycle\n\nTurn off cameras and LED lights\nSwap cameras and batteries for fresh units\nSecure frame and equipment for transit between sites\n\n\n\n\n4. Return to Main Vessel\nUpon completion of all deployments, the team returns to the main vessel for data processing and equipment maintenance.\nEquipment processing:\n\nRinse winch, rigs, and bait containers thoroughly with fresh water\nRemove cameras and SD cards from all systems\nSecure equipment for vessel transit\n\nData transfer: Ensure quick and secure data handling\n\nCopy video files to secure storage systems using standardized folder structure:\n\nLeft camera footage: station_id-L folder (e.g., FJI-2025-sbruv-001-L)\nRight camera footage: station_id-R folder (e.g., FJI-2025-sbruv-001-R)\n\nClear SD cards for next deployment cycle only after verifying successful file transfer\nRecord complete deployment metadata in standardized digital fieldbooks\n\nQuality assessment and highlight management: Review footage and extract highlights\n\nScan footage for preliminary highlights and notable observations\nExtract highlight clips and save to appropriate highlights folder on NAS\nLabel highlights using standardized format: station_id_[depth_m]_[taxa].mp4\n\nExample: PLW_2023_sbruv_001_45m_grey_reef_shark.mp4\n\nAssess video quality and equipment performance\n\nNext-day preparation: Ensure operational readiness for next deployments\n\nPlace all batteries on charge\nSet fresh bait to thaw\nRecharge winch battery as needed\n\n\n\n\nEnd-of-Expedition Procedures\nFinal expedition activities ensure complete data security and equipment readiness for future operations. These procedures are essential for preserving the scientific value of collected data and maintaining equipment functionality.\nData verification: Ensure comprehensive data preservation\n\nVerify all video files are backed up to multiple secure storage systems\nComplete deployments fieldbook\nFinalize highlight video clips for scientific and outreach purposes\n\nMaintenance and storage: Prepare equipment for storage\n\nThoroughly clean and maintain all BRUVS components\nPrepare systems for storage and transport\nUpdate equipment inventory\nNote any equipment issues or replacement needs for future expeditions"
