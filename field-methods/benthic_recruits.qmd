## Introduction

Coral recruitment is a fundamental process driving reef recovery, resilience, and long-term persistence. The Pristine Seas coral recruit survey methodology provides standardized protocols for quantifying juvenile coral abundance, taxonomic composition, and size distribution across different habitats and depths. 

## Overview

The coral recruit survey protocol involves systematically examining fixed-area quadrats along a transect to identify and measure juvenile coral colonies. This approach provides quantitative data on recruitment density, taxonomic patterns, and early post-settlement survival, enabling assessments of reef recovery potential.

### Key Features

- **Standardized quadrats**: Fixed-area sampling units (50 × 50 cm)
- **Systematic placement**: Regular intervals along the LPI transect
- **Size-based approach**: Focus on colonies ≤5 cm maximum diameter
- **Taxonomic resolution**: Identification to genus or species level when possible
- **Photographic documentation**: Each quadrat is photographed before examination
- **Integration**: Same transect line used for LPI and invertebrate surveys

## Field Implementation

The recruit survey is typically conducted by the recruit/invert diver as part of the three-person benthic survey team. This specialized diver completes both the coral recruit and invertebrate surveys during a single dive, performing these tasks in sequence.

- **Quadrat dimensions**: 50 × 50 cm (0.25 m²)
- **Quadrat placement**: Every 5 m along the transect (10 quadrats total)
- **Placement positions**: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 m marks
- **Timing**: Conducted before invertebrate surveys
- **Target size range**: Corals ≤5 cm maximum diameter

### Data Collection Procedure

1. **Deployment coordination**:
   - The recruit survey utilizes the same 50 m transect line deployed for the LPI survey
   - Begin at the 0 m mark and proceed along the transect

2. **Quadrat placement**:
   - Place the quadrat on the substrate at each 5 m interval along the transect (0, 5, 10, ..., 40, and 45 m marks)
   - The combined survey area across all quadrats is 2.5 m² per transect

3. **Quadrat documentation**:
   - Before searching for juveniles, take a photograph looking down into each quadrat

4. **Quadrat examination**:
   - Systematically search the entire quadrat area
   - Focus on colonies ≤5 cm maximum diameter that have a distinct tissue and skeletal boundary
   - Exclude fragments or remnants of larger colonies

4. **Data recording**:
   - For each juvenile coral within the quadrat:
     * Identify to lowest possible taxonomic level (genus or species)
     * Measure maximum diameter to the nearest 0.5 mm (for colonies larger than 0.5 cm)
     * Note the quadrat number to link records back to the quadrat image
     * Document attachment substrate type
     * Note any partial mortality, bleaching, or disease
   - Record quadrat-level information:
     * Dominant substrate type
     * Approximate sediment cover (%)

5. **Photo documentation**:
   - Photograph unidentified or unusual recruits for later verification
   - Take reference images of representative recruits
   - Capture full quadrat images

6. **Completion and transition**:
   - After examining all 10 quadrats, stow equipment securely
   - Transition to invertebrate surveys (working back along the same transect)

## Taxonomic Resolution

Juvenile corals are often difficult to identify to species level due to their small size and undeveloped morphological features. Given these constraints, our survey employs a pragmatic approach to taxonomic resolution.

1. **Genus-level identification** for most recruits
2. **Species-level identification** when morphological features are sufficiently developed
3. **Family-level grouping** for the smallest recruits (≤1 cm)
4. **Photographic documentation** for verification and training purposes

## Data Processing

### Data Entry

Coral recruit data are recorded in standardized Excel fieldbooks on the same day of data collection, while information and memory are fresh. The `ISO3_YEAR_recruits_fieldbook.xlsx` is organized as follows:

- `readme` sheet: Contains expedition info, data entry instructions, and guidelines
- `stations` sheet: Records station information including sampling depths, habitat types, and any deviations from protocol
- `recruits` sheet: Primary data entry for all coral recruits, including , size measurements and substrate type, and quadrat level info

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple" title="**Quadrat Image Organization**"}

The systematic organization of quadrat images is essential for later reference and quality control

  - All images should be named following the convention: [exp_id]_[site]_[depth]_[quadrat#].jpg
  - Images should be stored in a folder structure mirroring the site>station hierarchy

:::

### Processing Pipeline

The data processing workflow follows these key steps:

1. **File Consolidation**:
   - Merge data across expedition legs and divers
   - Standardize taxonomic names
   - Integrate with site metadata from the UVS Sites Fieldbook

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Verify completeness of required fields
   - Flag outliers for size measurements
   - Cross-reference taxonomic entries against adult coral taxa observed in LPI
   - Ensure consistent species identifications across observers

3. **Density Calculation**:
   - Calculate recruit density per unit area (recruits/m²)
   - Generate summary statistics by taxa, size class, site, and region
   - Create standardized density metrics for comparisons

4. **Size Structure Analysis**:
   - Group recruits into standardized size classes
   - Analyze size frequency distributions by taxa and site
   - Calculate size-based demographic metrics

5. **Database Integration**:
   - Format processed data for database ingestion
   - Apply appropriate metadata tags and quality indicators
   - Ensure consistency with other UVS components

### Core Output Files

The pipeline generates several essential files:

- **recruits_observations.csv**: Cleaned observations with standardized taxonomy
- **recruits_density_by_taxa.csv**: Density calculations by taxa, size class, and station
- **recruits_station_summary.csv**: Aggregate metrics by station
- **recruits_taxa_summary.csv**: Occurrence and density by taxa across regions

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Standard analyses conducted for coral recruit data include:

- **Recruitment Patterns**:
  - Taxonomic composition of recruits across sites
  - Recruitment density comparisons by region, habitat, and depth
  - Correlation with adult coral cover from LPI

- **Size Structure**:
  - Size frequency distributions by taxa
  - Proportional representation across size classes

- **Substrate Preferences**:
  - Settlement substrate analysis by taxa
  - Relationship between substrate availability and recruitment

- **Spatial Visualization**:
  - Geographic pattern analysis
  - Integration with environmental variables

## Limitations

The quadrat methodology for coral recruit surveys has several inherent limitations:

- **Detection challenges**: The smallest recruits (<5 mm) are extremely difficult to detect in field conditions, potentially leading to underestimates of recent recruitment
- **Taxonomic uncertainty**: Accurate species-level identification of recruits is challenging and often not possible for the smallest size classes
- **Spatial heterogeneity**: Recruitment can be highly patchy, requiring sufficient sample sizes to characterize site-level patterns
- **Temporal variability**: Recruitment is often episodic, with significant seasonal and annual variations that may not be captured in single surveys
- **Post-settlement mortality**: High mortality rates in the first weeks after settlement mean that visible recruits represent only a small fraction of initial settlers

These limitations can be addressed through:

- Comprehensive diver training in recruit detection and identification
- Adequate sample sizes (minimum of 10 quadrats per depth)
- Integration with longer-term monitoring where applicable
- Size-based classification to distinguish cohorts
