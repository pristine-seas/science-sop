## Introduction

Coral recruitment is a fundamental process driving reef recovery, resilience, and long-term persistence. The Pristine Seas coral recruit survey methodology provides standardized protocols for quantifying juvenile coral abundance, taxonomic composition, and size distribution across different habitats and depths. These surveys complement our benthic composition data (LPI) by documenting the recruitment processes that determine future reef trajectories, especially in the context of increasing disturbance frequency.

## Overview

The coral recruit survey method involves systematically examining fixed-area quadrats along a transect to identify and measure recently settled corals (recruits) and juvenile colonies. This approach provides quantitative data on recruitment intensity, taxonomic patterns, and early post-settlement survival, enabling assessments of reef recovery potential.

### Key Features

- **Standardized quadrats**: Fixed-area sampling units (25 × 25 cm)
- **Systematic placement**: Regular intervals along the LPI transect
- **Size-based approach**: Focus on colonies ≤5 cm maximum diameter
- **Taxonomic resolution**: Identification to genus or species level when possible
- **Integration**: Same transect line used for LPI and invertebrate surveys

## Field Implementation

The recruit survey is typically conducted by the recruit/invert diver as part of the three-person benthic survey team. This specialized diver completes both the coral recruit and invertebrate surveys during a single dive, performing these tasks in sequence.

- **Quadrat dimensions**: 25 × 25 cm (0.0625 m²)
- **Quadrat placement**: Every 5 m along the transect (10 quadrats total)
- **Placement positions**: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 m marks
- **Timing**: Conducted before invertebrate surveys
- **Target size range**: Corals ≤5 cm maximum diameter

### Data Collection Procedure

1. **Deployment coordination**:
   - The recruit survey utilizes the same 50 m transect line deployed for the LPI survey
   - Begin at the 0 m mark and proceed along the transect

2. **Quadrat placement**:
   - Place the quadrat on the substrate at each 5 m interval along the transect
   - Position the corner of the quadrat at the corresponding meter mark

3. **Quadrat examination**:
   - Systematically search the entire quadrat area
   - Search for colonies ≤5 cm diameter (both established juveniles and recent recruits)

4. **Data recording**:
   - For each coral recruit/juvenile within the quadrat:
     * Identify to lowest possible taxonomic level (genus or species)
     * Measure maximum diameter (to nearest mm)
     * Note attachment substrate type
     * Document any partial mortality, bleaching, or disease
   - Record quadrat-level information:
     * Rugosity category (low, medium, high)
     * Dominant substrate type
     * Approximate sediment cover (%)

5. **Photo documentation**:
   - Photograph unidentified or unusual recruits
   - Take reference images of representative recruits
   - Capture full quadrat images

6. **Completion and transition**:
   - After examining all 10 quadrats, stow equipment securely
   - Transition to invertebrate surveys (working back along the same transect)

## Taxonomic Resolution

Coral recruits and juveniles are often difficult to identify to species level due to their small size and undeveloped morphological features. The recruit survey employs a pragmatic approach to taxonomic resolution:

1. **Genus-level identification** for most recruits
2. **Species-level identification** when morphological features are sufficiently developed
3. **Family-level grouping** for the smallest recruits (≤1 cm)
4. **Photographic documentation** for verification and training purposes

### Common Juvenile Coral Characteristics

The identification of coral juveniles requires specialized knowledge of early colony morphology. Common characteristics used for identification include:

#### Acroporidae
- **Acropora**: Early radial corallites, pale margins, initial branch formation
- **Montipora**: Thin plating or encrusting growth, fine surface texture

#### Pocilloporidae
- **Pocillopora**: Verrucae (wart-like bumps) begin to form early
- **Stylophora**: Initial branches are thick and blunt
- **Seriatopora**: More delicate early polyp formations than other pocilloporids

#### Poritidae
- **Porites**: Characteristic porous surface, often mound-shaped
- **Goniopora**: Extended polyps when active, visible 24 septal arrangement

#### Agariciidae
- **Pavona**: Early formation of distinct ridges and valleys
- **Leptoseris**: Extremely thin, encrusting colonies with fine septocostae

## Attachment Substrate

The substrate to which coral recruits are attached is recorded using these categories:

## Data Processing

### Data Entry

Coral recruit data are entered into standardized Excel fieldbooks with the following structure:

- `readme` sheet: Contains expedition info, data entry instructions, and guidelines
- `stations` sheet: Records station information including sampling depths, habitat types, and any deviations from protocol
- `recruits` sheet: Primary data entry for all coral recruits, including , size measurements and substrate type, and quadrat level info

### Processing Pipeline

The data processing workflow follows these key steps:

1. **File Consolidation**:
   - Merge data across expedition legs and divers
   - Standardize taxonomic names
   - Integrate with site metadata from the UVS Sites Fieldbook

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Verify completeness of required fields
   - Flag outliers for size measurements
   - Cross-reference taxonomic entries against adult coral taxa observed in LPI
   - Ensure consistent species identifications across observers

3. **Density Calculation**:
   - Calculate recruit density per unit area (recruits/m²)
   - Generate summary statistics by taxa, size class, site, and region
   - Create standardized density metrics for comparisons

4. **Size Structure Analysis**:
   - Group recruits into standardized size classes
   - Analyze size frequency distributions by taxa and site
   - Calculate size-based demographic metrics

5. **Database Integration**:
   - Format processed data for database ingestion
   - Apply appropriate metadata tags and quality indicators
   - Ensure consistency with other UVS components

### Core Output Files

The pipeline generates several essential files:

- **recruits_observations.csv**: Cleaned observations with standardized taxonomy
- **recruits_density_by_taxa.csv**: Density calculations by taxa, size class, and station
- **recruits_station_summary.csv**: Aggregate metrics by station
- **recruits_taxa_summary.csv**: Occurrence and density by taxa across regions

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Standard analyses conducted for coral recruit data include:

- **Recruitment Patterns**:
  - Taxonomic composition of recruits across sites
  - Recruitment density comparisons by region, habitat, and depth
  - Correlation with adult coral cover from LPI

- **Size Structure**:
  - Size frequency distributions by taxa
  - Proportional representation across size classes

- **Substrate Preferences**:
  - Settlement substrate analysis by taxa
  - Relationship between substrate availability and recruitment

- **Spatial Visualization**:
  - Geographic pattern analysis
  - Integration with environmental variables

## Limitations

The quadrat methodology for coral recruit surveys has several inherent limitations:

- **Detection challenges**: The smallest recruits (<5 mm) are extremely difficult to detect in field conditions, potentially leading to underestimates of recent recruitment
- **Taxonomic uncertainty**: Accurate species-level identification of recruits is challenging and often not possible for the smallest size classes
- **Spatial heterogeneity**: Recruitment can be highly patchy, requiring sufficient sample sizes to characterize site-level patterns
- **Temporal variability**: Recruitment is often episodic, with significant seasonal and annual variations that may not be captured in single surveys
- **Post-settlement mortality**: High mortality rates in the first weeks after settlement mean that visible recruits represent only a small fraction of initial settlers

These limitations can be addressed through:

- Comprehensive diver training in recruit detection and identification
- Adequate sample sizes (minimum of 10 quadrats per depth)
- Integration with longer-term monitoring where applicable
- Size-based classification to distinguish cohorts

## Special Considerations

### Morphological Plasticity

Juvenile corals often display different morphologies than adult colonies of the same species, requiring specialized identification skills. Characteristics used for adult coral identification may not be apparent in recruits, necessitating a focus on skeletal structures and early growth patterns.

### Ecological Significance

While coral recruitment is essential for reef recovery, it does not guarantee successful reef replenishment. The survival and growth of recruits into reproductively active adult colonies depend on multiple factors including:

- Herbivore abundance (algal control)
- Predation pressure
- Environmental conditions
- Frequency of disturbance events

Therefore, recruitment data should be interpreted alongside other ecological indicators.
