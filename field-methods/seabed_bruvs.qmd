## Introduction

Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS) deployed on the seabed provide our most effective tool for quantifying predatory fish assemblages across diverse coastal marine environments. This versatile methodology samples fish communities from shallow mangrove channels to deep reef slopes, sandy plains to coral formations, and high-energy reef passes to sheltered lagoons—including habitats inaccessible to divers.

As a completely passive method, seabed BRUVS eliminate observer effects that influence fish behavior during diver-based surveys. Fish respond naturally to bait without human presence, providing unbiased observations particularly valuable for documenting sharks, rays, large groupers, and other predators that avoid divers. BRUVS are especially important for assessing shark populations, as shark relative abundance serves as one of the most reliable indicators of reef ecosystem health.

The method provides standardized measurements of fish diversity, relative abundance (MaxN), and body size across depths and habitats not accessible through other survey techniques, making it essential for comprehensive ecosystem assessment.


## Method Overview

Seabed BRUVS employ stereo-camera systems with standardized bait to attract and record fish, operating as autonomous underwater observatories. This approach provides relative abundance estimates and precise length measurements for all observed taxa

### Features

- **Habitat versatility**: Effective from shallow mangroves to deep reefs (5-70+ m)
- **Substrate adaptability**: Functions on sand, mud, rubble, coral, and rocky bottoms
- **Current tolerance**: Operates in calm lagoons to high-flow reef passes
- **Passive sampling**: Eliminates diver-induced behavioral bias
- **Stereo cameras**: Precise length measurements via calibrated camera separation
- **Standardized bait**: Consistent attraction stimulus across deployments
- **Extended observation**: Captures species with different response times to bait attraction

### Key metric

The fundamental measurement unit in BRUVS surveys is **MaxN** (Maximum Number): the highest count of individuals of a given species observed simultaneously in a single video frame during the entire deployment. MaxN provides a conservative, standardized abundance index that accounts for individual fish moving in and out of the camera's field of view.

- Eliminates double-counting of the same individuals
- Provides consistent abundance estimates across different deployment conditions
- Enables robust comparisons between sites, regions, and time periods
- Remains conservative when fish behavior varies



## Field Implementation

### Equipment 

The system consists of a robust carbon fiber frame housing a stereo camera configuration with standardized bait attraction.

#### Frame Structure

The BRUVS frame provides a stable foundation for varied conditions:

- **Camera bar**: 80 cm carbon fiber bar housing stereo cameras at optimal separation
- **Bait arm**: 1 m horizontal carbon fiber pole extending from camera bar to position attractant within camera view
- **Stabilization**: Three carbon fiber weighted legs (2 kg per leg, 6 kg total) creating low center of gravity for secure positioning
- **Surface connection**: Marker buoy connected via 30-100 m line with scope adjusted for deployment depth

#### Camera System

The stereo camera configuration enables precise fish identification and measurement:

- **Cameras**: Two GoPro Hero 9+ in waterproof housings
- **Stereo separation**: 80 cm distance, 8° convergence angle toward bait
- **Recording settings**: 1080p at 25-30 fps for optimal stereo analysis
- **Duration**: Minimum 60 minutes continuous recording
- **Synchronization**: Time-synchronized for stereo-photogrammetric measurements

#### Bait Protocol

Standardized bait ensures consistent fish attraction across deployments:

- **Quantity**: 1 kg crushed oily fish per deployment
- **Species**: Sardines, tuna, mackerel, or locally available oily fish
- **Preparation**: Fresh bait crushed on deployment day for maximum scent dispersal
- **Container**: Perforated PVC canister allowing scent release while containing bait
- **Positioning**: Suspended 1 m horizontally from camera bar within optimal camera field of view

#### Lighting System

Depth-dependent lighting ensures adequate video quality for species identification:

- **Shallow deployments (≤30 m)**: Natural light sufficient; no artificial lighting used
- **Deep deployments (>30 m)**: Two 2600 lumen LED lights mounted on camera bar
- **Light positioning**: Angled to illuminate bait area without creating backscatter
- **Battery management**: Fresh batteries for each deployment cycle

### Operations Schedule

BRUVS deployments are conducted using small boats with autonomous operations independent of the main research vessel:

**Daily Workflow:**

- **Morning (7 AM - 12 PM)**: Primary deployments (1-2 three-rig sets)
- **Afternoon (1-5 PM)**: Secondary deployments OR data processing and equipment maintenance
- **Evening**: Data backup, equipment preparation, and next-day planning

**Team Structure:**

- **Small boat crew**: 2-3 person team including boat operator and BRUVS specialists
- **Set duration**: 4-5 hours including deployment, 60-minute soak time, and recovery
- **Communication**: Regular check-ins with main vessel within radio/satellite communication range

### Site Selection

BRUVS deployment sites are strategically selected to maximize habitat coverage while ensuring successful deployments:

**Habitat Extension Approach:**

- **Complement diver surveys**: Access environments beyond SCUBA limits
- **Depth extension**: Survey deeper reef slopes (>20 m) inaccessible to divers
- **Habitat diversity**: Sample seagrass beds, channels, sandy flats, and deep coral formations
- **Geographic coverage**: Expand total survey area, particularly for large islands or atolls

**Critical Deployment Factors:** Substrate slope is the most critical factor determining deployment success

- **Optimal slope**: Mild or steep but with ledges or stable substrate

**Equipment Status:**

- Rid and camera IDs
- Bait type

**Video Quality Assessment:**
Each deployment receives a standardized quality rating:

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="**Video Quality Rating Scale**"}
Rate overall footage usability on a 5-point scale:

- **Excellent (5)** — Perfect footage from both cameras, optimal positioning and lighting
- **Good (4)** — Usable footage with minor issues (slight positioning problems, brief obstructions)
- **Fair (3)** — Analyzable despite significant problems (single camera functioning, partial obstructions)
- **Poor (2)** — Barely usable due to major issues (poor orientation, significant positioning problems)
- **Failed (1)** — No analyzable footage (equipment failure, complete obstruction, lost deployment)

This assessment determines inclusion in subsequent analyses and helps track equipment performance.

### Video Analysis

Video footage undergoes systematic analysis by our collaborating partners at the University of Western Australia (UWA) and the University of the South Pacific (Fiji) using EventMeasure software. All video is processed up to a 60-minute cutoff following standard protocols to identify each individual animal to the lowest possible taxonomic resolution, record the maximum number of each taxa observed in a single video frame (MaxN), and generate length estimates based on stereo-photogrammetric measurements of fork length.

![Illustration of BRUVS system deployment showing how the stereo cameras and bait attract sharks, rays, and other predatory fish](../assets/illustrations/seabed_bruvs_panel.jpg){fig-alt="BRUVS measurments" fig-align="center" width="60%"}

Video-based identification presents unique opportunities and challenges compared to diver-based surveys:

- **Repeated observation**: Fish can be observed multiple times throughout deployment
- **Detailed examination**: Pause, replay, and zoom capabilities enable careful species examination
- **Collaborative identification**: Multiple taxonomic experts can review challenging identifications
- **Permanent record**: Video provides lasting evidence for taxonomic verification

### Processing Pipeline

Raw fieldbook data and video annotations are integrated and processed through standardized R scripts that validate data, calculate metrics, and generate analysis-ready datasets.

#### 1. Data Integration and QA/QC

**File Consolidation:**
- Merge deployment metadata with video analysis results
- Standardize taxonomic names using reference database
- Validate spatial and temporal data consistency

**Quality Control Checks:**
- Review video quality ratings and exclude failed deployments (rating < 3)

- Check length measurements against known species ranges

#### 2. Taxonomic Standardization

**PS Database Integration:**

- Map taxa to accepted scientific names via `taxonomy.fish`
- Assign trophic groups and functional classifications
- Add length-weight relationships for biomass calculations
- Flag new records or range extensions for verification

#### 3. Ecological Metric Calculation

**Community Structure Metrics:**

- **Species richness**: Total number of taxa per deployment
- **Shannon diversity**: Account for both richness and evenness
- **Simpson diversity**: Emphasize dominant species
- **Functional diversity**: Based on trophic and ecological groups

**Abundance and Biomass:**

- **MaxN summaries**: Species-specific abundance indices by deployment
- **Biomass estimates**: Length-based calculations using allometric relationships
- **Trophic structure**: Proportional abundance/biomass by functional group
- **Size spectra**: Community size distributions and mean body sizes

**Conservation Metrics:**

## Limitations

While seabed BRUVS provide valuable standardized data on predatory fish assemblages, several methodological limitations should be acknowledged when interpreting results.

#### Sampling Bias

**Bait Attraction Variability:** Fish responses to bait vary significantly among species and individuals. Some species show strong positive attraction, others exhibit active avoidance, and territorial species may exclude other fish from the immediate area around the bait.

**Size and Behavioral Bias:** Larger, more aggressive predators may dominate bait areas, potentially excluding smaller individuals or species. This can lead to underestimation of juvenile abundance and species that are less competitive around bait.

**Temporal Coverage:** Standard 60-minute deployments provide only a brief snapshot of fish community activity. Species with different temporal activity patterns (dawn/dusk activity, tidal influences) may be missed or underrepresented.

#### Technical Limitations

**Environmental Dependency:** Successful deployments require suitable sea conditions and stable substrate. Steep slopes, strong currents, poor visibility, or equipment failure can result in partial or complete data loss.

**Detection Limitations:** MaxN provides minimum abundance estimates as individuals moving in and out of the camera's field of view may not be detected simultaneously. Video quality affects species identification accuracy, particularly for smaller or more cryptic species.

#### Methodological Considerations

**Observer Effect Elimination vs. Limited Behavior:** While BRUVS eliminate diver effects, they may not capture natural feeding behaviors, territorial interactions, or species that don't respond to bait stimulus.

**Community Representation:** BRUVS excel at documenting predatory fish but systematically underrepresent small-bodied species, herbivores, and planktivores compared to visual surveys.

**Standardization Challenges:** Variations in bait type, quantity, freshness, and local availability may affect comparability between deployments and regions.

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Complementary Methods:** We integrate BRUVS with UVS, eDNA, and other techniques to provide comprehensive ecosystem assessment that accounts for each method's strengths and biases.

**Standardized Protocols:** Protocols for equipment preparation, deployment procedures, and data analysis ensure valid comparisons across sites and time periods.

**Quality Control:** Multiple deployment replication, video quality assessment, and expert taxonomic review address technical and analytical sources of error.

**Appropriate Interpretation:** Results are interpreted within the context of method-specific limitations, focusing on questions that BRUVS are well-suited to address: predator abundance, community structure, and fishing impacts.
